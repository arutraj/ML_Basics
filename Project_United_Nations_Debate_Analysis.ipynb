Like most of the\\npeople in the world today, I was not even alive during the\\nconvulsive world war that convinced humankind of the need\\nfor this Organization, nor during the San Francisco\\nConference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed the\\nwork of the United Nations throughout my life, with\\nadmiration for its accomplishments, sadness for its failures\\nand the conviction that, through common effort, our\\ngeneration can take the bold steps needed to redeem the\\nmission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. I\\npledge to you that my nation remains committed to helping\\nmake the United Nations vision a reality.\\nThe start of this session of the General Assembly offers\\nus an opportunity to take stock of where we are as common\\nshareholders in the progress of humankind and the\\npreservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at a\\nturning point in human history.\\nImmense and promising changes seem to wash over us\\nevery day. The cold war is over. The world is no longer\\ndivided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of new\\ndemocracies have been born.\\nIt is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandela\\nstand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming a\\ndate for South Africa\\u2019s first non-racial elections.\\nWe see Russia\\u2019s first popularly elected President,\\nBoris Yeltsin, leading his nation on its bold democratic\\njourney.\\nWe have seen decades of deadlock shattered in the\\nMiddle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and the\\nChairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reached\\npast enmity and suspicion to shake each other\\u2019s hand and\\nexhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace.\\nWe have begun to see the doomsday weapons of\\nnuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty-two\\nyears ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly that\\nhumanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hung\\nby the slenderest of threads. Now the United States is\\nworking with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others to take\\nthat sword down, to lock it away in a secure vault, where we\\nhope and pray it will remain for ever.\\nIt is a new era in this Hall as well. The super-Power\\nstandoff that for so long stymied the work of the United\\nNations, almost from its first day, has now yielded to a new\\npromise of practical cooperation.\\nYet today we must all admit that there are two\\npowerful tendencies working from opposite directions to\\nchallenge the authority of nation States everywhere and to\\nundermine the authority of nation States to work together.\\nFrom beyond nations, economic and technological forces all\\nover the globe are compelling the world towards integration.\\nThese forces are fuelling a welcome explosion of\\nentrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they also\\nthreaten to destroy the insularity and independence of\\nnational economies, quickening the pace of change and\\nmaking many of our people feel more insecure. At the same\\ntime, from within nations, the resurgent aspirations of ethnic\\nand religious groups challenge Governments on terms that\\ntraditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. These\\ntwin forces lie at the heart of the challenges, not only to our\\nnational Governments, but also to all our international\\ninstitutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find new\\nways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our\\nnational interests and to think anew about whether our\\ninstitutions of international cooperation are adequate to this\\nmoment.\\nThus, as we marvel at this era\\u2019s promise of new peace,\\nwe must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloody\\nethnic, religious and civil wars rage from Angola to the\\nCaucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fall\\ninto more hands, even small conflicts can threaten to take on\\nmurderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to take\\na tragic toll, especially among the world\\u2019s children. The\\nmalignant neglect of our global environment threatens our\\nchildren\\u2019s health and their very security. The repression of\\nconscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism,\\nwhich has taken so many innocent lives, assumed a\\nhorrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanatics\\nbombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack even\\nthis very Hall of peace.\\nLet me assure the Assembly that whether they be the\\nplotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombed\\nPan Am flight 103, my Government is determined to see that\\nsuch terrorists are brought to justice.\\nAt this moment of panoramic change, of vast\\nopportunities and troubling threats, we must all ask ourselves\\nwhat we can and what we should do as a community of\\nnations. We must once again dare to dream of what might\\nbe, for our dreams may be within our reach.\\nFor that to happen, we must all be willing honestly to\\nconfront the challenges of the broader world. That has never\\nbeen easy. When this Organization was founded 48 years\\nago, the world\\u2019s nations stood devastated by war or\\nexhausted by its expense. There was little appetite for\\ncooperative efforts among nations; most people simply\\nwanted to get on with their lives. But a far-sighted\\ngeneration of leaders from the United States and elsewhere\\nrallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post-\\n-war security and prosperity.\\nWe are at a similar moment today. The momentum of\\nthe cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. And\\nwith daunting economic and political pressures upon almost\\nevery nation represented in this room, many of us are\\nturning to focus greater attention and energy on domestic\\nneeds and problems, and we must.\\nBut putting each of our economic houses in order\\ncannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. The\\npursuit of self-renewal in many of the world\\u2019s largest and\\nmost powerful economies - in Europe, in Japan, in North\\nAmerica - is absolutely crucial, because unless the great\\nindustrial nations can recapture their robust economic\\ngrowth, the global economy will languish. Yet the industrial\\nnations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own.\\nIndeed, prosperity in each of our nations and regions also\\ndepends on active and responsible engagement in a host of\\nshared concerns: for example, a thriving and democratic\\nRussia not only makes the world safer, it also can help to\\nexpand the world\\u2019s economy; a strong GATT (General\\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement will create\\nmillions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East,\\nbuttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated United\\nNations resolutions, can help to unleash that region\\u2019s great\\neconomic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension in\\nglobal affairs; and the growing economic power of China -\\ncoupled with greater political openness - could bring\\nenormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world.\\nWe must help our publics to understand this distinction:\\ndomestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism and\\nprotectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoples\\nto look beyond their immediate fears towards a broader\\nhorizon.\\nLet me start by being clear about where the United\\nStates stands. The United States occupies a unique position\\nin world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcome\\nit. Yet, with the cold war over, I know many people ask\\nwhether the United States plans to retreat or remain active\\nin the world; and if active, to what end? Many people are\\nasking that in our own country as well.\\nLet me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I\\ncan. The United States intends to remain engaged and to\\nlead. We cannot solve every problem, but we must and will\\nserve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace.\\nIn a new era of peril and opportunity, our overriding\\npurpose must be to expand and strengthen the world\\u2019s\\ncommunity of market-based democracies. During the cold\\nwar, we sought to contain a threat to the survival of free\\ninstitutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations that\\nlive under those free institutions.\\nFor our dream is of a day when the opinions and\\nenergies of every person in the world will be given full\\nexpression, in a world of thriving democracies that cooperate\\nwith each other and live in peace.\\nWith this statement, I do not mean to announce some\\ncrusade to force our way of life and doing things on others\\nor to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearly\\nthat throughout the world, from Poland to Eritrea, from\\nGuatemala to South Korea, there is an enormous yearning\\namong people who wish to be the masters of their own\\neconomic and political lives. Where it matters most and\\nwhere we can make the greatest difference, we will therefore\\npatiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning.\\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 9\\nToday, there are still those who claim that democracy\\nis simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recent\\nexpansion is an aberration, an accident in history that will\\nsoon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt, who\\nonce said: \\\"The democratic aspiration is no mere recent\\nphase of human history. It is human history.\\\"\\nWe will work to strengthen the free market democracies\\nby revitalizing our economy at home, by opening world\\ntrade through GATT, the North American Free Trade\\nAgreement and other accords, and by updating our shared\\ninstitutions, asking with you and answering the hard\\nquestions about whether they are adequate to the present\\nchallenges.\\nWe will support the consolidation of market democracy\\nwhere it is taking new root, as in the States of the former\\nSoviet Union and all over Latin America, and we seek to\\nfoster the practices of good government that distribute the\\nbenefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to all\\npeople.\\nWe will work to reduce the threat from regimes that are\\nhostile to democracy and to support liberalization of\\nnon-democratic States when they are willing to live in peace\\nwith the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial,\\nethnic and religious groups within our borders, our policy is\\nand must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world\\u2019s\\nreligions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhere\\nextremism that produces terrorism and hate.\\nAnd we must pursue our humanitarian goals of\\nreducing suffering, fostering sustainable development and\\nimproving health and living conditions, particularly for our\\nworld\\u2019s children.\\nOn efforts from export controls to trade agreements to\\npeace-keeping, we will often work in partnership with others\\nand through multilateral institutions such as the United\\nNations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we must\\nnot hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to our\\ncore interests or to those of our allies.\\nThe United States believes that an expanding\\ncommunity of market democracies not only serves our own\\nsecurity interests, it also advances the goals enshrined in this\\nbody\\u2019s Charter and its Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights.\\nFor broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongest\\nform of preventive diplomacy, and the habits of democracy\\nare the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted in\\ncompromise, not conquest. It rewards tolerance, not hatred.\\nDemocracies rarely wage war on one another. They make\\nmore reliable partners in trade, in diplomacy, and in the\\nstewardship of our global environment. And democracies,\\nwith the rule of law and respect for political, religious and\\ncultural minorities, are more responsive to their own people\\nand to the protection of human rights.\\nBut as we work towards this vision, we must confront\\nthe storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darken\\nthe march towards freedom.\\nIf we do not stem the proliferation of the world\\u2019s\\ndeadliest weapons, no democracy can feel secure.\\nIf we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflicts\\namong and within nations, those conflicts will smother the\\nbirth of free institutions, threaten the development of entire\\nregions and continue to take innocent lives.\\nIf we do not nurture our people and our planet through\\nsustainable development, we will deepen conflict and waste\\nthe very wonders that make our efforts worth doing.\\nLet me talk more about what I believe we must do in\\neach of these three categories: non-proliferation, conflict\\nresolution and sustainable development.\\nOne of our most urgent priorities must be attacking the\\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction - whether\\nnuclear, chemical or biological - and the ballistic missiles\\nthat can rain them down on populations hundreds of miles\\naway.\\nWe know this is not an idle problem. All of us are still\\nhaunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cut\\ndown by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop during\\nthe Gulf War that would have been far graver in their\\nconsequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And we\\nknow that many nations still believe it is in their interests to\\ndevelop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or the\\nnecessary technologies to others for financial gain.\\nMore than a score of nations likely possess such\\nweapons and their number threatens to grow. These\\nweapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a local\\nconflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe.\\nWe simply have got to find ways to control these weapons\\nand to reduce the number of States that possess them by\\nsupporting and strengthening the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency and by taking other necessary measures.\\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\\nI have made non-proliferation one of our nation\\u2019s\\nhighest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into\\nthe fabric of all of our relationships with the world\\u2019s nations\\nand institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing\\npressure for non-proliferation but increasingly open trade and\\ntechnology for those States that live by accepted\\ninternational rules.\\nToday, let me describe several new policies that our\\nGovernment will pursue to stem proliferation. We will\\npursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear\\nweapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and\\nhighly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear\\nterrorism for all nations. We will press for an international\\nagreement that would ban production of these materials for\\nweapons for ever.\\nAs we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States\\nhas also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban on\\nnuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate\\nthose negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if\\nall other nuclear States would do the same. Today, in the\\nface of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear\\nStates to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop\\nnuclear testing for all time.\\nI am also proposing new efforts to fight the\\nproliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today,\\nonly a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons\\nConvention. I call on all nations - including my own - to\\nratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by\\n13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen the\\nbiological weapons Convention by making every nation\\u2019s\\nbiological activities and facilities open to more international\\nscrutiny.\\nI am proposing as well new steps to thwart the\\nproliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with\\nRussia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made\\nsignificant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to\\nstrengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control\\nRegime by transforming it from an agreement on technology\\ntransfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that can\\ncommand universal adherence.\\nWe will also reform our own system of export controls\\nin the United States to reflect the realities of the post-cold-\\nwar world, where we seek to enlist the support of our former\\nadversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the same\\ntime as we stop deadly technologies from falling into the\\nwrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove\\noutdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce\\nand unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the\\nworld.\\nAs we work to keep the world\\u2019s most destructive\\nweapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the\\ninternational community\\u2019s ability to address those conflicts\\nthemselves. For as we all now know so painfully, the end\\nof the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace.\\nIndeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of\\nethnic, religious and territorial animosity.\\nThe philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a wounded\\nnationalism is like a bent twig, forced down so severely that\\nwhen released, it lashes back with fury. The world today is\\nthick with both bent and recoiling twigs of wounded\\ncommunal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts has\\nplaced high demands on the United Nations peace-keeping\\nforces. Frequently, the Blue Helmets have worked wonders.\\nIn Namibia, El Salvador, the Golan Heights and elsewhere,\\nUnited Nations peace-keepers have helped to stop the\\nfighting, restore civil authority and enable free elections. In\\nBosnia, United Nations peace-keepers, against the danger\\nand frustration of that continuing tragedy, have maintained\\na valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to that\\nconflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace, the\\ninternational community - including the United States - must\\nbe ready to help in its effective implementation.\\nIn Somalia, the United States and the United Nations\\nhave worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarian\\nrescue, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives and\\nrestoring conditions of security to almost the entire country.\\nUnited Nations peace-keepers from over two dozen nations\\nremain in Somalia today - and some, including brave\\nAmericans, have lost their lives - to ensure that we complete\\nour mission and that anarchy and starvation do not return\\njust as quickly as they were abolished.\\nMany still criticize United Nations peace-keeping, but\\nthose who do should talk to the people of Cambodia, where\\nthe United Nations operations helped turn the killing fields\\ninto fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May\\u2019s elections in\\nCambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war--\\nweary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleased\\nto announce that the United States has recognized\\nCambodia\\u2019s new Government.\\nUnited Nations peace-keeping holds the promise to\\nresolve many of this era\\u2019s conflicts. But the reason we have\\nsupported such missions is not, as some critics in the United\\nStates have charged, to subcontract American foreign policy,\\nbut to strengthen our security, to protect our interests, and to\\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11\\nshare among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace.\\nPeace-keeping cannot be a substitute for our own national\\ndefence efforts, but it can strongly supplement them.\\nToday there is wide recognition that the United Nations\\npeace-keeping ability has not kept pace with its rising\\nresponsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago, about\\n10,000 United Nations peace-keepers were stationed around\\nthe world. Today the United Nations has some 80,000\\ndeployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet until\\nrecently, if a peace-keeping commander called in from\\nacross the globe when it was night-time here in New York,\\nthere was no one in the peace-keeping office even to answer\\nthe call. When lives are on the line, we cannot let the reach\\nof the United Nations exceed its grasp.\\nAs the Secretary-General and others have argued, if\\nUnited Nations peace-keeping is to be a sound security\\ninvestment for our nation and for other United Nations\\nMembers, it must adapt to new times. Together, we must\\nprepare United Nations peace-keeping for the twenty-first\\ncentury. We need to begin by bringing the rigours of\\nmilitary and political analysis to every United Nations peace\\nmission. In recent weeks in the Security Council, our nation\\nhas begun asking harder questions about proposals for new\\npeace-keeping missions. Is there a real threat to\\ninternational peace? Does the proposed mission have clear\\nobjectives? Can an end point be identified for those who\\nwill be asked to participate? How much will the mission\\ncost? From now on the United Nations should address these\\nand other questions for every proposed mission before we\\nvote and before the mission begins. The United Nations\\nsimply cannot become engaged in every one of the world\\u2019s\\nconflicts. If the American people are to say \\\"Yes\\\" to United\\nNations peace-keeping, the United Nations must know when\\nto say \\\"No\\\".\\nThe United Nations also must have the technical means\\nto run a modern, world-class peace-keeping operation. We\\nsupport the creation of a genuine United Nations peace-\\nkeeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access to\\ntimely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployed\\non a moment\\u2019s notice; and with a modern operations centre\\nwith global communications.\\nUnited Nations operations must not only be adequately\\nfunded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks,\\nthe United States will be current on our peace-keeping bills.\\nI have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I\\nbelieve the United States should lead the way in being\\ntimely in its payments, and I will work to ensure that we\\ncontinue to pay our peace-keeping bills in full. But I am\\nalso committed to working with the United Nations to reduce\\nour nation\\u2019s assessment for these missions. The assessment\\nsystem has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in\\nour country knows that our percentage of the world\\u2019s\\neconomic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I\\nbelieve our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other\\nnations that can now bear more of the financial burden.\\nThat will make it easier for me as President to make sure\\nmy country pays in a timely and full fashion.\\nChanges in the United Nations peace-keeping operations\\nmust be part of an even broader programme of United\\nNations reform. I say that, again, not to criticize the United\\nNations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador,\\nMadeleine Albright, has suggested, the United States has\\nalways played a twin role in regard to the United Nations:\\n\\\"First friend and first critic.\\\"\\nToday, corporations around the world are finding ways\\nto move from the industrial age into the information age -\\nimproving service, reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs.\\nHere in the United States, Vice President Al Gore and I have\\nlaunched an effort literally to reinvent how our Government\\noperates. We see this going on in other Governments\\naround the world. Now the time has come to reinvent the\\nway the United Nations operates as well.\\nI applaud the initial steps the Secretary-General has\\ntaken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy.\\nNow we must all do even more to root out waste. Before\\nthis General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong\\nmandate for an office of inspector general, so that it can\\nattain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for\\neffectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our\\npeople that the United Nations is changing with the needs of\\nour times.\\nUltimately, the key for reforming the United Nations,\\nas for reforming our own government, is to remember why\\nwe are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that the\\nfirst words of the United Nations Charter are not, \\\"We the\\nGovernments\\\", but \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\".\\nThat means, in every country, the teachers, the workers, the\\nfarmers, the professionals, the fathers, the mothers, the\\nchildren, from the most remote village in the world to the\\nlargest metropolis - they are why we gather in this great\\nHall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail to\\nact; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills.\\nAs we dream new dreams in this age when miracles\\nseem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and\\nespecially on the children who will inherit this world. Let\\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\\nus work with a new urgency, and imagine what kind of\\nworld we could create for them over the coming generation.\\nLet us work with new energy to protect the world\\u2019s\\npeople from torture and repression. As Secretary of State\\nChristopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference, human\\nrights are not something conditional, bounded by culture but,\\nrather, something universal, granted by God. This General\\nAssembly should create, at long last, a high commissioner\\nfor human rights. I hope it will do this soon, and with\\nvigour and energy and conviction.\\nLet us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil our\\nobligations as custodians of this planet, not only to improve\\nthe quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air,\\nwater and the earth itself, but also because the roots of\\nconflict are so often entangled with the roots of\\nenvironmental neglect and the calamities of famine and\\ndisease.\\nDuring the course of our campaign in the United States\\nlast year, Vice President Gore and I promised the American\\npeople major changes in our nation\\u2019s policy towards the\\nglobal environment. Those were promises to keep, and\\ntoday the United States is doing so. Today we are working\\nwith other nations to build on the promising work of the\\nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.\\nWe are working to make sure that all nations meet their\\ncommitments under the global climate Convention. We are\\nseeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the\\nworld\\u2019s deserts from further expanding. And we seek to\\nstrengthen the World Health Organization\\u2019s efforts to combat\\nthe plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but\\nalso exhausting the resources of the nations that can least\\nafford it.\\nAnd let us make a new commitment to the world\\u2019s\\nchildren. It is tragic enough that one and a half million\\nchildren have died as a result of wars over the past decade.\\nBut it is far more unforgivable that during that same period\\n40 million children have died from diseases completely\\npreventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day\\n- this day, as we meet here - over 30,000 of the world\\u2019s\\nchildren will die of malnutrition and disease. As the\\nDirector of the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),\\nJim Grant, has reminded me, \\\"each of [those children] had\\na name and a nationality, a family, a personality and a\\npotential\\\".\\nWe are compelled to do better by the world\\u2019s children.\\nJust as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure\\nthat every child has adequate health care, we must do more\\nto get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable\\ndiseases to children all over the world. It\\u2019s the best\\ninvestment we\\u2019ll ever make. We can find new ways to\\nensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water\\n- that most precious commodity of life itself. And the\\nUnited Nations can work even harder to ensure that each\\nchild has at least a full primary education - and I mean that\\nopportunity for girls as well as boys.\\nTo ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we\\nsimply must slow the world\\u2019s explosive growth in\\npopulation. We cannot afford to see the human race double\\nby the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last\\nrenewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to\\nexpand the availability of the world\\u2019s family planning\\neducation and services. We must ensure that there is a place\\nat the table for every one of the world\\u2019s children. We can\\ndo this.\\nAt the birth of this Organization, 48 years ago - another\\ntime of both victory and danger - a generation of gifted\\nleaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the\\nworld\\u2019s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. One\\nAmerican leader during that period said this: \\\"It is time we\\nsteered by the stars rather than by the light of each passing\\nship.\\\" His generation picked peace, human dignity and\\nfreedom. Those are good stars. They should remain the\\nhighest in our firmament.\\nNow history has granted to us a moment of even\\ngreater opportunity, when old dangers are ebbing and old\\nwalls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us, every\\none of us, above all by what we make of this magic\\nmoment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger, that we\\nwill work harder, so that they can conclude that we did not\\nmerely turn walls to rubble, but instead laid the foundations\\nfor great things to come.\\nLet us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracy\\nis not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Let\\nus ensure that the world\\u2019s most dangerous weapons are\\nsafely reduced and denied to dangerous hands. Let us\\nensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier,\\nsafer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today. I\\nbelieve - I know - that together we can extend this moment\\nof miracles into an age of great works and new wonders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"48\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1993\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'\\ufeffI am honoured to address the General Assembly today at the beginning of its forty-fourth session. I should like to congratulate Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a distinguished diplomat, on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly, and I wish him success in his presidency.\\nI feel a great personal pleasure on this occasion, for this is a homecoming for both Barbara and me. The memories of my time here in 1971 and 1972 are still with me today - the human moments, the humorous moments that are part of even the highest undertaking.\\nWith the Assembly\\'s permission, I should like to share one story from one of the many meetings of the Security Council. I was the Permanent Representative of the United States, and I was 45 minutes late for the meeting. All 45 minutes were filled by the first speaker to take the floor, and when I walked in and took my seat the speaker paused, with great courtesy, and said: \"I welcome the Permanent Representative of the United States. And now, for his benefit, I will start my speech all over again, from the beginning.\"\\nThat is a true story, at that moment. differences of alliance and ideology didn\\'t matter. The universal groan that went up around that table from every representative present, and the laughter that followed united us all. Today, I would like to begin by recognising - again, a personal privilege - the current Permanent Representatives with whom I served, Ambassador Dugersuren, Ambassador Martinez Ordonez. Ambassador Pabetafika and Permanent Observer Dube. It is wonderful to look around and see so any familiar faces - foreign ministers, members of the Secretariat, and delegates. Of course, the Secretary-General, you were the Permanent representative of your country when we served together. Under-Secretary-General Farah. you were a Permanent Representative back then too. Ambassador Aguilar was here then and is now back. It is an honour to be back with you in this historic Hall, and I apologize if , have forgotten any of you old enough to have served in 1971 and 1972.\\n\\nThe United Nations was established forty-four years ago upon the ashes of war and amidst great hopes. The UN can do great things. No, the United Nations is not perfect, it is not a panacea for the world\\'s problem. But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus, and it must remain a forum for peace. The UN has the support of the United States of America. In recent years, the war of words that is often echoed in this Hall has been giving way to a new mood. \\nWe have seen a welcome shift from polemics to peace-keeping. United Nations Peace-keepers have given their lives in service to the United Nations. Today, should like to remember one of those soldiers of peace, an American on a mission of peace under the United Nations flag, on a mission for all the world, a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving, dedication to the United Nations ideal - Lieutenant-Colonel William Richard Higgins. I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace and to call on those responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family. Let us all - right now, right here - dedicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that Colonel Higgins served so selflessly.\\nThe founders of this historic institution believed that it was here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law, not force, shall govern. And the United Nations can play a fundamental role in the central issue of our time, for today, there is an idea at work around the globe, an idea of undeniable force - and that idea is freedom. Freedom\\'s advance is evident everywhere.- Central Europe and Hungary, where State and society are now in the midst of a movement towards political pluralism and a free-market economy, where the barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between Hungary and its neighbours to the west has been torn down and replaced by a new hope for the future, a new hope in freedom. We see freedom at work in Poland, where, in deference to the will of the people, the Communist Party has relinquished its monopoly on power, and indeed in the Soviet Union, where the world hears the voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the right to rule themselves.\\nBut freedom\\'s march is not confined to a single continent or to the developed world alone. We see the rise of freedom in Latin America where, one by one, dictatorships are giving way to democracy. We see it on the continent of Africa, where more and more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for economies crippled by excessive State control. East and West, North and South, on every continent, we can see the outlines of a new world of freedom.\\nOf course, freedom\\'s work remains unfinished. The trend we see is not yet universal. Some regimes still stand against the tide. Some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern themselves. But now the power of prejudice and despotism is challenged. Never before have these regimes stood so isolated and alone, so out of step with the steady advance of freedom. Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful State. There are many reasons for this collapse, but in the end one fact alone explains what we see today: advocates of the totalitarian idea saw its triumph written in the laws of history, they failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart.\\nTwo hundred years ago today, the United States - our Congress - proposed the Bill of Rights: fundamental freedoms belonging to every individual. Rights no Government can deny. Those same rights have been recognized in this congress of nations in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. From where we stand, on the threshold of this new world of freedom, the trend is clear enough. If, for those who write the history of our times, the twentieth century is remembered as the century of the state, the twenty-first century must be an era of emancipation, the age of the individual. Make no mistake, nothing can stand in the way of freedom\\'s march. There will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to be the universal birthright of every man and woman, of every race and walk of life. Even under the worst circumstances, at the darkest of times, freedom has always remained alive - a distant dream, perhaps, but always alive.\\nToday, that dream is no longer distant. For the first time, for millions around the world, a new world of freedom is within reach. Today is freedom\\'s moment. You see, the possibility now exists for the creation of a true community of nations, built on shared interests and ideals. A true community, a world where free Governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people to control their own destiny, to live in dignity, and to exercise freely their fundamental human rights. It is time that worked together to deliver that destiny into the hands of men and women everywhere. Our challenge is to strengthen the foundations of freedom, encourage its advance and face our most urgent challenges, the global challenges of the twenty-first century: economic, health, environmental well-being, the great questions of war and peace.\\nFirst, global economic growth. During this decade, a number of developing nations have moved into the ranks of the world\\'s most advanced economies, all of them - each and every one - powered by the engine of free enterprise. In the decade ahead, others can join their ranks, but for many nations, barriers stand in the way. In the case of some countries, these are obstacles of their own making: un-needed restrictions, regulations that act as dead weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade. But other barriers to growth exist, and those, too, require effective action.\\nToo many developing countries struggle today under a burden of debt that makes growth all but impossible. The nations of the world deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over their own economic fate and build better lives for their own people. The approach the United States has put forward - the Brady plan - will help these nations reduce that debt and, at the same time, encourage the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth.\\nIn just two days, I will be speaking to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I will discuss there, in more detail, the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt problem. But I can say now the new world of freedom is not a world where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want. The power of commerce is a force for progress. Open markets are the key to continued growth in the developing world. Today, the United States buys over one-half of the global manufactured exports that all developing nations combined sell to the industrialized world. It is time for the other advanced economies to follow suit, to create expanded opportunities for trade. I believe we will learn, in the century ahead, that many nations of the world have barely begun to tap their true potential for development. The free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few, they are a harvest that everyone can share.\\nBeyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of global magnitude: the environment. No line drawn on a map can stop the advance of pollution. Threats to our environment have become international problems. We must develop an international approach to urgent environmental issues, one that seeks common solutions to common problems. The United Nations is already at work on the question of global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe. And I will tell you now the United States will do its part. We have committed ourselves to the world-wide phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. We have proposed amending our own Clean Air Act to ensure clean air for our citizens within a single generation. We have banned the import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the human predators who exterminate them for profit. And we have begun to explore ways to work with other nations, with the major industrialized democracies, and in Poland and in Hungary, to make common cause for the sake of our environment.\\nThe environment belongs to all of us. In this new world of freedom, the world\\'s citizens must enjoy this common trust for generations to come. Global economic growth and the stewardship of our planet - both are critical issues.\\nBut as always, questions of war and peace must be paramount to the United Nations. We must move forward to limit and eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Five years ago, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, I presented a United States draft treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Since then, progress has been made, but time is running out. The threat is growing. More than 20 nations now possess chemical weapons or the capability to produce them. And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. That is simply unacceptable. For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this threat.\\nToday I want to announce steps that the United States is ready to take, steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons, steps towards a treaty that will ban - eliminate - all chemical weapons from the Earth 10 years from the day it is signed. This initiative contains three major elements. First, in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty the United States is ready to destroy nearly all - 98 per cent - of our chemical weapons stockpile, provided the Soviet Union joins the ban, and I think it will. Secondly, we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons - 100 per cent, every one - within 10 years, once all nations capable of building chemical weapons sign that total-ban treaty. And thirdly, the United States is ready to begin now. We will eliminate more than 80 per cent of our stockpile even as we work to complete a treaty, if the Soviet Union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal level and if we agree on the conditions, including inspections, under which stockpiles are destroyed.\\nWe know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be a challenge. But the knowledge we have gained from our recent arms control experience and our accelerating research in this area makes me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to go forward with the ban. The world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare? so let us act together, beginning today, to rid the Earth of this scourge.\\nWe are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as well. And that is why we put forward new proposals just last Thursday at the negotiations in Vienna on conventional forces in Europe, proposals that demonstrate our commitment to act rapidly to ease military tensions in Europe and move the nations of that continent one step closer to their common destiny: a Europe whole and free.\\nThe United States is convinced that open and innovative measures can move disarmament forward and also ease international tensions. That is the idea behind the \"open skies\" proposal, about which the Soviets have now expressed a positive attitude. It is the idea behind the \"open lands\" proposal, permitting for the first time ever free travel for all Soviet and United States diplomats throughout each other\\'s countries. Openness is the enemy of mistrust, and every step towards a more open world is a step towards the new world we seek.\\nLet me make this comment on our meetings with the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Mr. Shevardnadze, over the past few days: I am very pleased by the progress made. The Soviet Union removed a number of obstacles to progress on conventional and strategic arms reductions. We reached agreements in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing. And, of course, we agreed to a summit in the spring or early summer of 1990. I look forward to meeting Mr. Gorbachev there.\\nEach of those achievements is important in its own right, but they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails between the United States and the USSR. Serious differences remain; we know that. But the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we and indeed the world must welcome. We have not entered into an era of perpetual peace. The threats to peace that nations face may today be changing, but they have not vanished. In fact, in a number of regions around the world, a dangerous combination is now emerging: regimes armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction. That development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out. Regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before.\\nThe challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all individuals right here in this Hall. Mr. Secretary-General, I say with great respect that you have made it your own. The United Nations can be a mediator, a forum where parties in conflict come in search of peaceful solutions. For the sake of peace, the United Nations must redouble its support for the peace efforts now under way in regions of conflict all over the world. I assure the Assembly that the United States is determined to take an active role in settling regional conflicts. Sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly public, and sometimes, like many others do, we work quietly behind the scenes. But always, we are working for positive change and lasting peace.\\nOur world faces other, less conventional threats no less dangerous to international peace and stability. Illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human misery wherever they gain a foothold. The nations which suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight, and we are. Let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of one country in particular: Colombia, where\\nwe are working with the people and their President, Virgil lo Barco, to put the drug cartels cut of business and bring the drug lords to justice.\\nFinally, we must join forces to combat the threat of terrorism. Every nation and the United Nations must send the outlaws of the world a clear message hostage-taking and the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win the world\\'s approval. Terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a civilized world holds in common. And make no mistake.- Terrorism is a means that no end, no matter how just, can sanctify.\\nWhatever the challenge, freedom greatly raises the chances of our success. Freedom\\'s moment is a time for hope for all of the world, because freedom, once set in motion, takes on a momentum of its own. As I said the day I assumed the presidency of our country, we do not have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We know that free government, democracy, is best. And I believe that is the hard-won truth of our time, the unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of great struggle and human suffering. And this is true not because all our differences must give way to democracy , but because democracy makes room for all our differences. In democracy, diversity finds its common home.\\nAt the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom of belief, freedom of thought and action, in all its diversity, for human rights. The world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have promised to remake man in some new and better image. We have seen the colossal tragedies and dashed hopes. We know now that freedom and democracy hold the answers: what men and nations want is the freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper, in peace.\\nWhen I began today I spoke to you about peace-keeping. I want to speak to you now about peace-making. We must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings. There is a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the White House which pictures President Abraham Lincoln and his generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest in the history of my country. Outside at that moment a battle rages, in this picture, and yet what we see in the distance is a rainbow, a symbol of hope, of the passing of the storm. That painting is called \"The Peace-makers\". For me, it is a constant reminder that our struggle, the struggle for peace, is a struggle blessed by hope.\\nI do remember sitting in this Hall, I remember the mutual respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives, yes, I remember the almost endless speeches - and I do not want this to be one of them - the Security Council sessions, the receptions, those long receiving lines, the formal meetings of the General Assembly, and the informal discussions in the delegates\\' lounge. And I remember something more, something beyond the frantic pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here: The heartbeat of the United Nations, the quiet conviction that we could make the world more peaceful, more free. What we sought then, all of us, now lies within our reach. I ask each of you here in this Hall:\\nCan we not bring a unity of purpose to the United Nations? Can we not make this new world of freedom the common destiny we seek? I believe we can. I know we must. My solemn wish today is that here, among the United Nations, that spirit will take hold, and that all men and all nations will make freedom\\'s moment their own.\\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless the work of the United Nations.  \\n'"

Like most of the\\npeople in the world today, I was not even alive during the\\nconvulsive world war that convinced humankind of the need\\nfor this Organization, nor during the San Francisco\\nConference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed the\\nwork of the United Nations throughout my life, with\\nadmiration for its accomplishments, sadness for its failures\\nand the conviction that, through common effort, our\\ngeneration can take the bold steps needed to redeem the\\nmission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. I\\npledge to you that my nation remains committed to helping\\nmake the United Nations vision a reality.\\nThe start of this session of the General Assembly offers\\nus an opportunity to take stock of where we are as common\\nshareholders in the progress of humankind and the\\npreservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at a\\nturning point in human history.\\nImmense and promising changes seem to wash over us\\nevery day. The cold war is over. The world is no longer\\ndivided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of new\\ndemocracies have been born.\\nIt is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandela\\nstand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming a\\ndate for South Africa\\u2019s first non-racial elections.\\nWe see Russia\\u2019s first popularly elected President,\\nBoris Yeltsin, leading his nation on its bold democratic\\njourney.\\nWe have seen decades of deadlock shattered in the\\nMiddle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and the\\nChairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reached\\npast enmity and suspicion to shake each other\\u2019s hand and\\nexhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace.\\nWe have begun to see the doomsday weapons of\\nnuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty-two\\nyears ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly that\\nhumanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hung\\nby the slenderest of threads. Now the United States is\\nworking with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others to take\\nthat sword down, to lock it away in a secure vault, where we\\nhope and pray it will remain for ever.\\nIt is a new era in this Hall as well. The super-Power\\nstandoff that for so long stymied the work of the United\\nNations, almost from its first day, has now yielded to a new\\npromise of practical cooperation.\\nYet today we must all admit that there are two\\npowerful tendencies working from opposite directions to\\nchallenge the authority of nation States everywhere and to\\nundermine the authority of nation States to work together.\\nFrom beyond nations, economic and technological forces all\\nover the globe are compelling the world towards integration.\\nThese forces are fuelling a welcome explosion of\\nentrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they also\\nthreaten to destroy the insularity and independence of\\nnational economies, quickening the pace of change and\\nmaking many of our people feel more insecure. At the same\\ntime, from within nations, the resurgent aspirations of ethnic\\nand religious groups challenge Governments on terms that\\ntraditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. These\\ntwin forces lie at the heart of the challenges, not only to our\\nnational Governments, but also to all our international\\ninstitutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find new\\nways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our\\nnational interests and to think anew about whether our\\ninstitutions of international cooperation are adequate to this\\nmoment.\\nThus, as we marvel at this era\\u2019s promise of new peace,\\nwe must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloody\\nethnic, religious and civil wars rage from Angola to the\\nCaucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fall\\ninto more hands, even small conflicts can threaten to take on\\nmurderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to take\\na tragic toll, especially among the world\\u2019s children. The\\nmalignant neglect of our global environment threatens our\\nchildren\\u2019s health and their very security. The repression of\\nconscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism,\\nwhich has taken so many innocent lives, assumed a\\nhorrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanatics\\nbombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack even\\nthis very Hall of peace.\\nLet me assure the Assembly that whether they be the\\nplotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombed\\nPan Am flight 103, my Government is determined to see that\\nsuch terrorists are brought to justice.\\nAt this moment of panoramic change, of vast\\nopportunities and troubling threats, we must all ask ourselves\\nwhat we can and what we should do as a community of\\nnations. We must once again dare to dream of what might\\nbe, for our dreams may be within our reach.\\nFor that to happen, we must all be willing honestly to\\nconfront the challenges of the broader world. That has never\\nbeen easy. When this Organization was founded 48 years\\nago, the world\\u2019s nations stood devastated by war or\\nexhausted by its expense. There was little appetite for\\ncooperative efforts among nations; most people simply\\nwanted to get on with their lives. But a far-sighted\\ngeneration of leaders from the United States and elsewhere\\nrallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post-\\n-war security and prosperity.\\nWe are at a similar moment today. The momentum of\\nthe cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. And\\nwith daunting economic and political pressures upon almost\\nevery nation represented in this room, many of us are\\nturning to focus greater attention and energy on domestic\\nneeds and problems, and we must.\\nBut putting each of our economic houses in order\\ncannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. The\\npursuit of self-renewal in many of the world\\u2019s largest and\\nmost powerful economies - in Europe, in Japan, in North\\nAmerica - is absolutely crucial, because unless the great\\nindustrial nations can recapture their robust economic\\ngrowth, the global economy will languish. Yet the industrial\\nnations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own.\\nIndeed, prosperity in each of our nations and regions also\\ndepends on active and responsible engagement in a host of\\nshared concerns: for example, a thriving and democratic\\nRussia not only makes the world safer, it also can help to\\nexpand the world\\u2019s economy; a strong GATT (General\\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement will create\\nmillions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East,\\nbuttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated United\\nNations resolutions, can help to unleash that region\\u2019s great\\neconomic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension in\\nglobal affairs; and the growing economic power of China -\\ncoupled with greater political openness - could bring\\nenormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world.\\nWe must help our publics to understand this distinction:\\ndomestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism and\\nprotectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoples\\nto look beyond their immediate fears towards a broader\\nhorizon.\\nLet me start by being clear about where the United\\nStates stands. The United States occupies a unique position\\nin world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcome\\nit. Yet, with the cold war over, I know many people ask\\nwhether the United States plans to retreat or remain active\\nin the world; and if active, to what end? Many people are\\nasking that in our own country as well.\\nLet me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I\\ncan. The United States intends to remain engaged and to\\nlead. We cannot solve every problem, but we must and will\\nserve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace.\\nIn a new era of peril and opportunity, our overriding\\npurpose must be to expand and strengthen the world\\u2019s\\ncommunity of market-based democracies. During the cold\\nwar, we sought to contain a threat to the survival of free\\ninstitutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations that\\nlive under those free institutions.\\nFor our dream is of a day when the opinions and\\nenergies of every person in the world will be given full\\nexpression, in a world of thriving democracies that cooperate\\nwith each other and live in peace.\\nWith this statement, I do not mean to announce some\\ncrusade to force our way of life and doing things on others\\nor to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearly\\nthat throughout the world, from Poland to Eritrea, from\\nGuatemala to South Korea, there is an enormous yearning\\namong people who wish to be the masters of their own\\neconomic and political lives. Where it matters most and\\nwhere we can make the greatest difference, we will therefore\\npatiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning.\\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 9\\nToday, there are still those who claim that democracy\\nis simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recent\\nexpansion is an aberration, an accident in history that will\\nsoon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt, who\\nonce said: \\\"The democratic aspiration is no mere recent\\nphase of human history. It is human history.\\\"\\nWe will work to strengthen the free market democracies\\nby revitalizing our economy at home, by opening world\\ntrade through GATT, the North American Free Trade\\nAgreement and other accords, and by updating our shared\\ninstitutions, asking with you and answering the hard\\nquestions about whether they are adequate to the present\\nchallenges.\\nWe will support the consolidation of market democracy\\nwhere it is taking new root, as in the States of the former\\nSoviet Union and all over Latin America, and we seek to\\nfoster the practices of good government that distribute the\\nbenefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to all\\npeople.\\nWe will work to reduce the threat from regimes that are\\nhostile to democracy and to support liberalization of\\nnon-democratic States when they are willing to live in peace\\nwith the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial,\\nethnic and religious groups within our borders, our policy is\\nand must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world\\u2019s\\nreligions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhere\\nextremism that produces terrorism and hate.\\nAnd we must pursue our humanitarian goals of\\nreducing suffering, fostering sustainable development and\\nimproving health and living conditions, particularly for our\\nworld\\u2019s children.\\nOn efforts from export controls to trade agreements to\\npeace-keeping, we will often work in partnership with others\\nand through multilateral institutions such as the United\\nNations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we must\\nnot hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to our\\ncore interests or to those of our allies.\\nThe United States believes that an expanding\\ncommunity of market democracies not only serves our own\\nsecurity interests, it also advances the goals enshrined in this\\nbody\\u2019s Charter and its Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights.\\nFor broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongest\\nform of preventive diplomacy, and the habits of democracy\\nare the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted in\\ncompromise, not conquest. It rewards tolerance, not hatred.\\nDemocracies rarely wage war on one another. They make\\nmore reliable partners in trade, in diplomacy, and in the\\nstewardship of our global environment. And democracies,\\nwith the rule of law and respect for political, religious and\\ncultural minorities, are more responsive to their own people\\nand to the protection of human rights.\\nBut as we work towards this vision, we must confront\\nthe storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darken\\nthe march towards freedom.\\nIf we do not stem the proliferation of the world\\u2019s\\ndeadliest weapons, no democracy can feel secure.\\nIf we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflicts\\namong and within nations, those conflicts will smother the\\nbirth of free institutions, threaten the development of entire\\nregions and continue to take innocent lives.\\nIf we do not nurture our people and our planet through\\nsustainable development, we will deepen conflict and waste\\nthe very wonders that make our efforts worth doing.\\nLet me talk more about what I believe we must do in\\neach of these three categories: non-proliferation, conflict\\nresolution and sustainable development.\\nOne of our most urgent priorities must be attacking the\\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction - whether\\nnuclear, chemical or biological - and the ballistic missiles\\nthat can rain them down on populations hundreds of miles\\naway.\\nWe know this is not an idle problem. All of us are still\\nhaunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cut\\ndown by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop during\\nthe Gulf War that would have been far graver in their\\nconsequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And we\\nknow that many nations still believe it is in their interests to\\ndevelop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or the\\nnecessary technologies to others for financial gain.\\nMore than a score of nations likely possess such\\nweapons and their number threatens to grow. These\\nweapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a local\\nconflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe.\\nWe simply have got to find ways to control these weapons\\nand to reduce the number of States that possess them by\\nsupporting and strengthening the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency and by taking other necessary measures.\\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\\nI have made non-proliferation one of our nation\\u2019s\\nhighest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into\\nthe fabric of all of our relationships with the world\\u2019s nations\\nand institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing\\npressure for non-proliferation but increasingly open trade and\\ntechnology for those States that live by accepted\\ninternational rules.\\nToday, let me describe several new policies that our\\nGovernment will pursue to stem proliferation. We will\\npursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear\\nweapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and\\nhighly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear\\nterrorism for all nations. We will press for an international\\nagreement that would ban production of these materials for\\nweapons for ever.\\nAs we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States\\nhas also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban on\\nnuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate\\nthose negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if\\nall other nuclear States would do the same. Today, in the\\nface of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear\\nStates to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop\\nnuclear testing for all time.\\nI am also proposing new efforts to fight the\\nproliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today,\\nonly a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons\\nConvention. I call on all nations - including my own - to\\nratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by\\n13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen the\\nbiological weapons Convention by making every nation\\u2019s\\nbiological activities and facilities open to more international\\nscrutiny.\\nI am proposing as well new steps to thwart the\\nproliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with\\nRussia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made\\nsignificant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to\\nstrengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control\\nRegime by transforming it from an agreement on technology\\ntransfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that can\\ncommand universal adherence.\\nWe will also reform our own system of export controls\\nin the United States to reflect the realities of the post-cold-\\nwar world, where we seek to enlist the support of our former\\nadversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the same\\ntime as we stop deadly technologies from falling into the\\nwrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove\\noutdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce\\nand unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the\\nworld.\\nAs we work to keep the world\\u2019s most destructive\\nweapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the\\ninternational community\\u2019s ability to address those conflicts\\nthemselves. For as we all now know so painfully, the end\\nof the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace.\\nIndeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of\\nethnic, religious and territorial animosity.\\nThe philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a wounded\\nnationalism is like a bent twig, forced down so severely that\\nwhen released, it lashes back with fury. The world today is\\nthick with both bent and recoiling twigs of wounded\\ncommunal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts has\\nplaced high demands on the United Nations peace-keeping\\nforces. Frequently, the Blue Helmets have worked wonders.\\nIn Namibia, El Salvador, the Golan Heights and elsewhere,\\nUnited Nations peace-keepers have helped to stop the\\nfighting, restore civil authority and enable free elections. In\\nBosnia, United Nations peace-keepers, against the danger\\nand frustration of that continuing tragedy, have maintained\\na valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to that\\nconflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace, the\\ninternational community - including the United States - must\\nbe ready to help in its effective implementation.\\nIn Somalia, the United States and the United Nations\\nhave worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarian\\nrescue, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives and\\nrestoring conditions of security to almost the entire country.\\nUnited Nations peace-keepers from over two dozen nations\\nremain in Somalia today - and some, including brave\\nAmericans, have lost their lives - to ensure that we complete\\nour mission and that anarchy and starvation do not return\\njust as quickly as they were abolished.\\nMany still criticize United Nations peace-keeping, but\\nthose who do should talk to the people of Cambodia, where\\nthe United Nations operations helped turn the killing fields\\ninto fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May\\u2019s elections in\\nCambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war--\\nweary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleased\\nto announce that the United States has recognized\\nCambodia\\u2019s new Government.\\nUnited Nations peace-keeping holds the promise to\\nresolve many of this era\\u2019s conflicts. But the reason we have\\nsupported such missions is not, as some critics in the United\\nStates have charged, to subcontract American foreign policy,\\nbut to strengthen our security, to protect our interests, and to\\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11\\nshare among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace.\\nPeace-keeping cannot be a substitute for our own national\\ndefence efforts, but it can strongly supplement them.\\nToday there is wide recognition that the United Nations\\npeace-keeping ability has not kept pace with its rising\\nresponsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago, about\\n10,000 United Nations peace-keepers were stationed around\\nthe world. Today the United Nations has some 80,000\\ndeployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet until\\nrecently, if a peace-keeping commander called in from\\nacross the globe when it was night-time here in New York,\\nthere was no one in the peace-keeping office even to answer\\nthe call. When lives are on the line, we cannot let the reach\\nof the United Nations exceed its grasp.\\nAs the Secretary-General and others have argued, if\\nUnited Nations peace-keeping is to be a sound security\\ninvestment for our nation and for other United Nations\\nMembers, it must adapt to new times. Together, we must\\nprepare United Nations peace-keeping for the twenty-first\\ncentury. We need to begin by bringing the rigours of\\nmilitary and political analysis to every United Nations peace\\nmission. In recent weeks in the Security Council, our nation\\nhas begun asking harder questions about proposals for new\\npeace-keeping missions. Is there a real threat to\\ninternational peace? Does the proposed mission have clear\\nobjectives? Can an end point be identified for those who\\nwill be asked to participate? How much will the mission\\ncost? From now on the United Nations should address these\\nand other questions for every proposed mission before we\\nvote and before the mission begins. The United Nations\\nsimply cannot become engaged in every one of the world\\u2019s\\nconflicts. If the American people are to say \\\"Yes\\\" to United\\nNations peace-keeping, the United Nations must know when\\nto say \\\"No\\\".\\nThe United Nations also must have the technical means\\nto run a modern, world-class peace-keeping operation. We\\nsupport the creation of a genuine United Nations peace-\\nkeeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access to\\ntimely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployed\\non a moment\\u2019s notice; and with a modern operations centre\\nwith global communications.\\nUnited Nations operations must not only be adequately\\nfunded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks,\\nthe United States will be current on our peace-keeping bills.\\nI have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I\\nbelieve the United States should lead the way in being\\ntimely in its payments, and I will work to ensure that we\\ncontinue to pay our peace-keeping bills in full. But I am\\nalso committed to working with the United Nations to reduce\\nour nation\\u2019s assessment for these missions. The assessment\\nsystem has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in\\nour country knows that our percentage of the world\\u2019s\\neconomic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I\\nbelieve our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other\\nnations that can now bear more of the financial burden.\\nThat will make it easier for me as President to make sure\\nmy country pays in a timely and full fashion.\\nChanges in the United Nations peace-keeping operations\\nmust be part of an even broader programme of United\\nNations reform. I say that, again, not to criticize the United\\nNations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador,\\nMadeleine Albright, has suggested, the United States has\\nalways played a twin role in regard to the United Nations:\\n\\\"First friend and first critic.\\\"\\nToday, corporations around the world are finding ways\\nto move from the industrial age into the information age -\\nimproving service, reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs.\\nHere in the United States, Vice President Al Gore and I have\\nlaunched an effort literally to reinvent how our Government\\noperates. We see this going on in other Governments\\naround the world. Now the time has come to reinvent the\\nway the United Nations operates as well.\\nI applaud the initial steps the Secretary-General has\\ntaken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy.\\nNow we must all do even more to root out waste. Before\\nthis General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong\\nmandate for an office of inspector general, so that it can\\nattain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for\\neffectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our\\npeople that the United Nations is changing with the needs of\\nour times.\\nUltimately, the key for reforming the United Nations,\\nas for reforming our own government, is to remember why\\nwe are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that the\\nfirst words of the United Nations Charter are not, \\\"We the\\nGovernments\\\", but \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\".\\nThat means, in every country, the teachers, the workers, the\\nfarmers, the professionals, the fathers, the mothers, the\\nchildren, from the most remote village in the world to the\\nlargest metropolis - they are why we gather in this great\\nHall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail to\\nact; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills.\\nAs we dream new dreams in this age when miracles\\nseem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and\\nespecially on the children who will inherit this world. Let\\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\\nus work with a new urgency, and imagine what kind of\\nworld we could create for them over the coming generation.\\nLet us work with new energy to protect the world\\u2019s\\npeople from torture and repression. As Secretary of State\\nChristopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference, human\\nrights are not something conditional, bounded by culture but,\\nrather, something universal, granted by God. This General\\nAssembly should create, at long last, a high commissioner\\nfor human rights. I hope it will do this soon, and with\\nvigour and energy and conviction.\\nLet us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil our\\nobligations as custodians of this planet, not only to improve\\nthe quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air,\\nwater and the earth itself, but also because the roots of\\nconflict are so often entangled with the roots of\\nenvironmental neglect and the calamities of famine and\\ndisease.\\nDuring the course of our campaign in the United States\\nlast year, Vice President Gore and I promised the American\\npeople major changes in our nation\\u2019s policy towards the\\nglobal environment. Those were promises to keep, and\\ntoday the United States is doing so. Today we are working\\nwith other nations to build on the promising work of the\\nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.\\nWe are working to make sure that all nations meet their\\ncommitments under the global climate Convention. We are\\nseeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the\\nworld\\u2019s deserts from further expanding. And we seek to\\nstrengthen the World Health Organization\\u2019s efforts to combat\\nthe plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but\\nalso exhausting the resources of the nations that can least\\nafford it.\\nAnd let us make a new commitment to the world\\u2019s\\nchildren. It is tragic enough that one and a half million\\nchildren have died as a result of wars over the past decade.\\nBut it is far more unforgivable that during that same period\\n40 million children have died from diseases completely\\npreventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day\\n- this day, as we meet here - over 30,000 of the world\\u2019s\\nchildren will die of malnutrition and disease. As the\\nDirector of the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),\\nJim Grant, has reminded me, \\\"each of [those children] had\\na name and a nationality, a family, a personality and a\\npotential\\\".\\nWe are compelled to do better by the world\\u2019s children.\\nJust as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure\\nthat every child has adequate health care, we must do more\\nto get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable\\ndiseases to children all over the world. It\\u2019s the best\\ninvestment we\\u2019ll ever make. We can find new ways to\\nensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water\\n- that most precious commodity of life itself. And the\\nUnited Nations can work even harder to ensure that each\\nchild has at least a full primary education - and I mean that\\nopportunity for girls as well as boys.\\nTo ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we\\nsimply must slow the world\\u2019s explosive growth in\\npopulation. We cannot afford to see the human race double\\nby the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last\\nrenewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to\\nexpand the availability of the world\\u2019s family planning\\neducation and services. We must ensure that there is a place\\nat the table for every one of the world\\u2019s children. We can\\ndo this.\\nAt the birth of this Organization, 48 years ago - another\\ntime of both victory and danger - a generation of gifted\\nleaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the\\nworld\\u2019s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. One\\nAmerican leader during that period said this: \\\"It is time we\\nsteered by the stars rather than by the light of each passing\\nship.\\\" His generation picked peace, human dignity and\\nfreedom. Those are good stars. They should remain the\\nhighest in our firmament.\\nNow history has granted to us a moment of even\\ngreater opportunity, when old dangers are ebbing and old\\nwalls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us, every\\none of us, above all by what we make of this magic\\nmoment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger, that we\\nwill work harder, so that they can conclude that we did not\\nmerely turn walls to rubble, but instead laid the foundations\\nfor great things to come.\\nLet us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracy\\nis not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Let\\nus ensure that the world\\u2019s most dangerous weapons are\\nsafely reduced and denied to dangerous hands. Let us\\nensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier,\\nsafer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today. I\\nbelieve - I know - that together we can extend this moment\\nof miracles into an age of great works and new wonders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"48\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1993\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Speech_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Let me first congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly for this session. Mr Secretary General, distinguished representatives and guests, it is a great honour for me to address you and to stand in this great Hall, which symbolizes so much of the twentieth century   its darkest crises and its brightest aspirations. I come before you as the first American President born after the founding of the United Nations. Like most of the people in the world today, I was not even alive during the convulsive world war that convinced humankind of the need for this Organization, nor during the San Francisco Conference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed the work of the United Nations throughout my life, with admiration for its accomplishments, sadness for its failures and the conviction that, through common effort, our generation can take the bold steps needed to redeem the mission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. I pledge to you that my nation remains committed to helping make the United Nations vision a reality. The start of this session of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity to take stock of where we are as common shareholders in the progress of humankind and the preservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at a turning point in human history. Immense and promising changes seem to wash over us every day. The cold war is over. The world is no longer divided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of new democracies have been born. It is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandela stand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming a date for South Africa\\u2019s first non racial elections. We see Russia\\u2019s first popularly elected President, Boris Yeltsin, leading his nation on its bold democratic journey. We have seen decades of deadlock shattered in the Middle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reached past enmity and suspicion to shake each other\\u2019s hand and exhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace. We have begun to see the doomsday weapons of nuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty two years ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly that humanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hung by the slenderest of threads. Now the United States is working with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others to take that sword down, to lock it away in a secure vault, where we hope and pray it will remain for ever. It is a new era in this Hall as well. The super Power standoff that for so long stymied the work of the United Nations, almost from its first day, has now yielded to a new promise of practical cooperation. Yet today we must all admit that there are two powerful tendencies working from opposite directions to challenge the authority of nation States everywhere and to undermine the authority of nation States to work together. From beyond nations, economic and technological forces all over the globe are compelling the world towards integration. These forces are fuelling a welcome explosion of entrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they also threaten to destroy the insularity and independence of national economies, quickening the pace of change and making many of our people feel more insecure. At the same time, from within nations, the resurgent aspirations of ethnic and religious groups challenge Governments on terms that traditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. These twin forces lie at the heart of the challenges, not only to our national Governments, but also to all our international institutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find new ways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our national interests and to think anew about whether our institutions of international cooperation are adequate to this moment. Thus, as we marvel at this era\\u2019s promise of new peace, we must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloody ethnic, religious and civil wars rage from Angola to the Caucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fall into more hands, even small conflicts can threaten to take on murderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to take a tragic toll, especially among the world\\u2019s children. The malignant neglect of our global environment threatens our children\\u2019s health and their very security. The repression of conscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism, which has taken so many innocent lives, assumed a horrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanatics bombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack even this very Hall of peace. Let me assure the Assembly that whether they be the plotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombed Pan Am flight 103, my Government is determined to see that such terrorists are brought to justice. At this moment of panoramic change, of vast opportunities and troubling threats, we must all ask ourselves what we can and what we should do as a community of nations. We must once again dare to dream of what might be, for our dreams may be within our reach. For that to happen, we must all be willing honestly to confront the challenges of the broader world. That has never been easy. When this Organization was founded 48 years ago, the world\\u2019s nations stood devastated by war or exhausted by its expense. There was little appetite for cooperative efforts among nations; most people simply wanted to get on with their lives. But a far sighted generation of leaders from the United States and elsewhere rallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post   war security and prosperity. We are at a similar moment today. The momentum of the cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. And with daunting economic and political pressures upon almost every nation represented in this room, many of us are turning to focus greater attention and energy on domestic needs and problems, and we must. But putting each of our economic houses in order cannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. The pursuit of self renewal in many of the world\\u2019s largest and most powerful economies   in Europe, in Japan, in North America   is absolutely crucial, because unless the great industrial nations can recapture their robust economic growth, the global economy will languish. Yet the industrial nations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own. Indeed, prosperity in each of our nations and regions also depends on active and responsible engagement in a host of shared concerns: for example, a thriving and democratic Russia not only makes the world safer, it also can help to expand the world\\u2019s economy; a strong GATT  agreement will create millions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East, buttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated United Nations resolutions, can help to unleash that region\\u2019s great economic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension in global affairs; and the growing economic power of China   coupled with greater political openness   could bring enormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world. We must help our publics to understand this distinction: domestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism and protectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoples to look beyond their immediate fears towards a broader horizon. Let me start by being clear about where the United States stands. The United States occupies a unique position in world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcome it. Yet, with the cold war over, I know many people ask whether the United States plans to retreat or remain active in the world; and if active, to what end? Many people are asking that in our own country as well. Let me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I can. The United States intends to remain engaged and to lead. We cannot solve every problem, but we must and will serve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace. In a new era of peril and opportunity, our overriding purpose must be to expand and strengthen the world\\u2019s community of market based democracies. During the cold war, we sought to contain a threat to the survival of free institutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations that live under those free institutions. For our dream is of a day when the opinions and energies of every person in the world will be given full expression, in a world of thriving democracies that cooperate with each other and live in peace. With this statement, I do not mean to announce some crusade to force our way of life and doing things on others or to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearly that throughout the world, from Poland to Eritrea, from Guatemala to South Korea, there is an enormous yearning among people who wish to be the masters of their own economic and political lives. Where it matters most and where we can make the greatest difference, we will therefore patiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning. Forty eighth session   27 September l993 9 Today, there are still those who claim that democracy is simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recent expansion is an aberration, an accident in history that will soon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt, who once said: The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase of human history. It is human history. We will work to strengthen the free market democracies by revitalizing our economy at home, by opening world trade through GATT, the North American Free Trade Agreement and other accords, and by updating our shared institutions, asking with you and answering the hard questions about whether they are adequate to the present challenges. We will support the consolidation of market democracy where it is taking new root, as in the States of the former Soviet Union and all over Latin America, and we seek to foster the practices of good government that distribute the benefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to all people. We will work to reduce the threat from regimes that are hostile to democracy and to support liberalization of non democratic States when they are willing to live in peace with the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial, ethnic and religious groups within our borders, our policy is and must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world\\u2019s religions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhere extremism that produces terrorism and hate. And we must pursue our humanitarian goals of reducing suffering, fostering sustainable development and improving health and living conditions, particularly for our world\\u2019s children. On efforts from export controls to trade agreements to peace keeping, we will often work in partnership with others and through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we must not hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to our core interests or to those of our allies. The United States believes that an expanding community of market democracies not only serves our own security interests, it also advances the goals enshrined in this body\\u2019s Charter and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongest form of preventive diplomacy, and the habits of democracy are the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted in compromise, not conquest. It rewards tolerance, not hatred. Democracies rarely wage war on one another. They make more reliable partners in trade, in diplomacy, and in the stewardship of our global environment. And democracies, with the rule of law and respect for political, religious and cultural minorities, are more responsive to their own people and to the protection of human rights. But as we work towards this vision, we must confront the storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darken the march towards freedom. If we do not stem the proliferation of the world\\u2019s deadliest weapons, no democracy can feel secure. If we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflicts among and within nations, those conflicts will smother the birth of free institutions, threaten the development of entire regions and continue to take innocent lives. If we do not nurture our people and our planet through sustainable development, we will deepen conflict and waste the very wonders that make our efforts worth doing. Let me talk more about what I believe we must do in each of these three categories: non proliferation, conflict resolution and sustainable development. One of our most urgent priorities must be attacking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction   whether nuclear, chemical or biological   and the ballistic missiles that can rain them down on populations hundreds of miles away. We know this is not an idle problem. All of us are still haunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cut down by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop during the Gulf War that would have been far graver in their consequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And we know that many nations still believe it is in their interests to develop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or the necessary technologies to others for financial gain. More than a score of nations likely possess such weapons and their number threatens to grow. These weapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a local conflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe. We simply have got to find ways to control these weapons and to reduce the number of States that possess them by supporting and strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency and by taking other necessary measures. 10 General Assembly   Forty eighth session I have made non proliferation one of our nation\\u2019s highest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into the fabric of all of our relationships with the world\\u2019s nations and institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing pressure for non proliferation but increasingly open trade and technology for those States that live by accepted international rules. Today, let me describe several new policies that our Government will pursue to stem proliferation. We will pursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear weapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and highly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear terrorism for all nations. We will press for an international agreement that would ban production of these materials for weapons for ever. As we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States has also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate those negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if all other nuclear States would do the same. Today, in the face of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear States to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop nuclear testing for all time. I am also proposing new efforts to fight the proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today, only a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons Convention. I call on all nations   including my own   to ratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by 13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen the biological weapons Convention by making every nation\\u2019s biological activities and facilities open to more international scrutiny. I am proposing as well new steps to thwart the proliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with Russia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made significant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to strengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control Regime by transforming it from an agreement on technology transfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that can command universal adherence. We will also reform our own system of export controls in the United States to reflect the realities of the post cold  war world, where we seek to enlist the support of our former adversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the same time as we stop deadly technologies from falling into the wrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove outdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce and unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the world. As we work to keep the world\\u2019s most destructive weapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the international community\\u2019s ability to address those conflicts themselves. For as we all now know so painfully, the end of the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace. Indeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of ethnic, religious and territorial animosity. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a wounded nationalism is like a bent twig, forced down so severely that when released, it lashes back with fury. The world today is thick with both bent and recoiling twigs of wounded communal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts has placed high demands on the United Nations peace keeping forces. Frequently, the Blue Helmets have worked wonders. In Namibia, El Salvador, the Golan Heights and elsewhere, United Nations peace keepers have helped to stop the fighting, restore civil authority and enable free elections. In Bosnia, United Nations peace keepers, against the danger and frustration of that continuing tragedy, have maintained a valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to that conflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace, the international community   including the United States   must be ready to help in its effective implementation. In Somalia, the United States and the United Nations have worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarian rescue, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives and restoring conditions of security to almost the entire country. United Nations peace keepers from over two dozen nations remain in Somalia today   and some, including brave Americans, have lost their lives   to ensure that we complete our mission and that anarchy and starvation do not return just as quickly as they were abolished. Many still criticize United Nations peace keeping, but those who do should talk to the people of Cambodia, where the United Nations operations helped turn the killing fields into fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May\\u2019s elections in Cambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war   weary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleased to announce that the United States has recognized Cambodia\\u2019s new Government. United Nations peace keeping holds the promise to resolve many of this era\\u2019s conflicts. But the reason we have supported such missions is not, as some critics in the United States have charged, to subcontract American foreign policy, but to strengthen our security, to protect our interests, and to Forty eighth session   27 September l993 11 share among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace. Peace keeping cannot be a substitute for our own national defence efforts, but it can strongly supplement them. Today there is wide recognition that the United Nations peace keeping ability has not kept pace with its rising responsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago, about 10,000 United Nations peace keepers were stationed around the world. Today the United Nations has some 80,000 deployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet until recently, if a peace keeping commander called in from across the globe when it was night time here in New York, there was no one in the peace keeping office even to answer the call. When lives are on the line, we cannot let the reach of the United Nations exceed its grasp. As the Secretary General and others have argued, if United Nations peace keeping is to be a sound security investment for our nation and for other United Nations Members, it must adapt to new times. Together, we must prepare United Nations peace keeping for the twenty first century. We need to begin by bringing the rigours of military and political analysis to every United Nations peace mission. In recent weeks in the Security Council, our nation has begun asking harder questions about proposals for new peace keeping missions. Is there a real threat to international peace? Does the proposed mission have clear objectives? Can an end point be identified for those who will be asked to participate? How much will the mission cost? From now on the United Nations should address these and other questions for every proposed mission before we vote and before the mission begins. The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world\\u2019s conflicts. If the American people are to say Yes to United Nations peace keeping, the United Nations must know when to say No. The United Nations also must have the technical means to run a modern, world class peace keeping operation. We support the creation of a genuine United Nations peace  keeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access to timely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployed on a moment\\u2019s notice; and with a modern operations centre with global communications. United Nations operations must not only be adequately funded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks, the United States will be current on our peace keeping bills. I have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I believe the United States should lead the way in being timely in its payments, and I will work to ensure that we continue to pay our peace keeping bills in full. But I am also committed to working with the United Nations to reduce our nation\\u2019s assessment for these missions. The assessment system has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in our country knows that our percentage of the world\\u2019s economic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I believe our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other nations that can now bear more of the financial burden. That will make it easier for me as President to make sure my country pays in a timely and full fashion. Changes in the United Nations peace keeping operations must be part of an even broader programme of United Nations reform. I say that, again, not to criticize the United Nations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador, Madeleine Albright, has suggested, the United States has always played a twin role in regard to the United Nations: First friend and first critic. Today, corporations around the world are finding ways to move from the industrial age into the information age   improving service, reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs. Here in the United States, Vice President Al Gore and I have launched an effort literally to reinvent how our Government operates. We see this going on in other Governments around the world. Now the time has come to reinvent the way the United Nations operates as well. I applaud the initial steps the Secretary General has taken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy. Now we must all do even more to root out waste. Before this General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong mandate for an office of inspector general, so that it can attain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for effectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our people that the United Nations is changing with the needs of our times. Ultimately, the key for reforming the United Nations, as for reforming our own government, is to remember why we are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that the first words of the United Nations Charter are not, We the Governments, but We the peoples of the United Nations. That means, in every country, the teachers, the workers, the farmers, the professionals, the fathers, the mothers, the children, from the most remote village in the world to the largest metropolis   they are why we gather in this great Hall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail to act; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills. As we dream new dreams in this age when miracles seem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and especially on the children who will inherit this world. Let 12 General Assembly   Forty eighth session us work with a new urgency, and imagine what kind of world we could create for them over the coming generation. Let us work with new energy to protect the world\\u2019s people from torture and repression. As Secretary of State Christopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference, human rights are not something conditional, bounded by culture but, rather, something universal, granted by God. This General Assembly should create, at long last, a high commissioner for human rights. I hope it will do this soon, and with vigour and energy and conviction. Let us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil our obligations as custodians of this planet, not only to improve the quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air, water and the earth itself, but also because the roots of conflict are so often entangled with the roots of environmental neglect and the calamities of famine and disease. During the course of our campaign in the United States last year, Vice President Gore and I promised the American people major changes in our nation\\u2019s policy towards the global environment. Those were promises to keep, and today the United States is doing so. Today we are working with other nations to build on the promising work of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. We are working to make sure that all nations meet their commitments under the global climate Convention. We are seeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the world\\u2019s deserts from further expanding. And we seek to strengthen the World Health Organization\\u2019s efforts to combat the plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but also exhausting the resources of the nations that can least afford it. And let us make a new commitment to the world\\u2019s children. It is tragic enough that one and a half million children have died as a result of wars over the past decade. But it is far more unforgivable that during that same period 40 million children have died from diseases completely preventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day   this day, as we meet here   over 30,000 of the world\\u2019s children will die of malnutrition and disease. As the Director of the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund , Jim Grant, has reminded me, each of  had a name and a nationality, a family, a personality and a potential. We are compelled to do better by the world\\u2019s children. Just as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure that every child has adequate health care, we must do more to get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable diseases to children all over the world. It\\u2019s the best investment we\\u2019ll ever make. We can find new ways to ensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water   that most precious commodity of life itself. And the United Nations can work even harder to ensure that each child has at least a full primary education   and I mean that opportunity for girls as well as boys. To ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we simply must slow the world\\u2019s explosive growth in population. We cannot afford to see the human race double by the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last renewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to expand the availability of the world\\u2019s family planning education and services. We must ensure that there is a place at the table for every one of the world\\u2019s children. We can do this. At the birth of this Organization, 48 years ago   another time of both victory and danger   a generation of gifted leaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the world\\u2019s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. One American leader during that period said this: It is time we steered by the stars rather than by the light of each passing ship. His generation picked peace, human dignity and freedom. Those are good stars. They should remain the highest in our firmament. Now history has granted to us a moment of even greater opportunity, when old dangers are ebbing and old walls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us, every one of us, above all by what we make of this magic moment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger, that we will work harder, so that they can conclude that we did not merely turn walls to rubble, but instead laid the foundations for great things to come. Let us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracy is not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Let us ensure that the world\\u2019s most dangerous weapons are safely reduced and denied to dangerous hands. Let us ensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier, safer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today. I believe   I know   that together we can extend this moment of miracles into an age of great works and new wonders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Thank you for the honour of addressing the General Assembly. The American people respect the idealism that gave life to this Organization. And we respect the men and women of the United Nations, who stand for peace and human rights in every part of the world. Welcome to New York City, and welcome to the United States of America. During the past three years, I have addressed the General Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country, and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at a time of tremendous opportunity for the United Nations and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the circle of liberty, security and development has been expanding in our world. This progress has brought unity to Europe, self government to Latin America and Asia and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic 8  chance to widen the circle even further, to fight radicalism and terror with justice and dignity and to achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom. The United Nations and my country share the deepest commitments. Both the American Declaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of every human life. That dignity is honoured by the rule of law, limits on the power of the State, respect for women, protection of private property, free speech, equal justice and religious tolerance. That dignity is dishonoured by oppression, corruption, tyranny, bigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent. Both our founding documents affirm that this bright line between justice and injustice between right and wrong is the same in every age, every culture and every nation. Wise Governments also stand for these principles for very practical and realistic reasons. We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know that oppressive Governments support terror, while free Governments fight the terrorists in their midst. We know that free peoples embrace progress and life, instead of becoming the recruits for murderous ideologies. Every nation that wants peace will share the benefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks peace has an obligation to help build that world. Eventually there is no safe isolation from terror networks, or failed States that shelter them, or outlaw regimes or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others. In this young century our world needs a new definition of security. Our security is not merely found in spheres of influence or some balance of power. The security of our world is found in the advancing rights of mankind. Those rights are advancing across the world. And across the world, the enemies of human rights are responding with violence. Terrorists and their allies believe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United States Bill of Rights and every charter of liberty ever written are lies to be burned and destroyed and forgotten. They believe that dictators should control every mind and tongue in the Middle East and beyond. They believe that suicide and torture and murder are fully justified to serve any goal they declare. And they act on their beliefs. In the last year alone terrorists have attacked police stations and banks and commuter trains and synagogues and a school filled with children. This month in Beslan we saw once again how the terrorists measure their success in the death of the innocent and in the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was held hostage along with her son and her nephew. Her nephew did not survive. She recently visited the cemetery and saw what she called the “little graves”. She said, “I understand that there is evil in the world, but what have these little creatures done?” The Russian children did nothing to deserve such awful suffering and fright and death. The people of Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have done nothing to deserve sudden and random murder. Those acts violate the standards of justice in all cultures and the principles of all religions. All civilized nations are in this struggle together and all must fight the murderers. We are determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate, and the United States is grateful to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets, track down their operatives and disrupt their plans. We are determined to end the State sponsorship of terror, and my nation is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. We are determined to prevent proliferation and to enforce the demands of the world, and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many nations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlaw dictator. The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a ceasefire, to fully comply with all Security Council resolutions, then ignored more than a decade of those resolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised serious consequences for his defiance. The commitments we make must have meaning. When we say “serious consequences”, for the sake of peace there must be serious consequences. So a coalition of nations enforced the just demands of the world. Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough. Our broader mission as United Nations Members is to apply those ideals to the great issues of our time. Our wider goal is to promote hope and progress as the alternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose is to build a better world beyond the war on terror. 9  Because we believe in human dignity, the United States and many other nations have established a Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In three years the contributing countries have funded projects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total of $5.6 billion to those efforts. America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a special focus on 15 countries where the need is most urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time, and our unprecedented commitment will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of death. Because we believe in human dignity, the United States and many other nations have joined together to confront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We are supporting organizations that rescue the victims, passing stronger anti trafficking laws and warning travellers that they will be held to account for supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and children should never be exploited for pleasure or greed, anywhere on Earth. Because we believe in human dignity, we should take seriously the protection of life from exploitation under any pretext. In this session, the General Assembly will consider a draft resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning. I support that draft resolution and urge all Governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: no human life should ever be produced or destroyed for the benefit of another. Because we believe in human dignity, the United States and many other nations have changed the way we fight poverty, curb corruption and provide aid. In 2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold approach that links new aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones. And through the Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is increasing our aid to developing nations that expand economic freedom and invest in the education and health of their own people. Because we believe in human dignity, the United States and many other nations have acted to lift the crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing economies and holds millions of people in poverty. Since those efforts began in 1996, poor countries with the heaviest debt burdens have received more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the build up of future debt, my country and other nations have agreed that international financial institutions should increasingly provide new aid in the form of grants rather than loans. Because we believe in human dignity, the world must have more effective means to stabilize regions in turmoil and to halt religious violence and ethnic cleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to respond to future crises. The United States and Italy have proposed a Global Peace Operations Initiative. Group of Eight  countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers initially from Africa so they can conduct operations on that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the G 8 will help that peacekeeping force with deployment and logistical needs. At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of the Sudan, crimes my Government has concluded are genocide. The United States played a key role in efforts to broker a ceasefire, and we are providing humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people. Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in the Sudan to help improve security so that aid can be delivered. The Security Council adopted a new resolution that supports an expanded African Union force to help prevent further bloodshed and that urges the Government of the Sudan to stop flights by military aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the Council on this timely and necessary action. I call on the Government of the Sudan to honour the ceasefire it signed, and to stop the killing in Darfur. Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful nations must stand for the advance of democracy. No other system of government has done more to protect minorities, to secure the rights of labour, to raise the status of women or to channel human energy to the pursuits of peace. We have witnessed the rise of democratic Governments in predominantly Hindu and Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures. Democratic institutions have taken root in modern societies and in traditional societies. When it comes to the desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of civilizations. People everywhere are capable of freedom and worthy of freedom. Finding the full promise of representative Government takes time, as America has found in two centuries of debate and struggle. Nor is there only one 10  form of representative Government, because democracies by definition take on the unique character of the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know with certainty: the desire for freedom resides in every human heart, and that desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls or martial laws or secret police. Over time and across the Earth, freedom will find a way. Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we must continue to show our commitment to democracies in those nations. The liberty that many have won at a cost must be secured. As Members of the United Nations, we all have a stake in the success of the world’s newest democracies. Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. Those regimes destabilized one of the world’s most vital and most volatile regions. They brutalized their peoples in defiance of all civilized norms. Today, the Iraqi and Afghan peoples are on the path to democracy and freedom. The Governments that are rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of harbouring terrorists, they are fighting terrorist groups. And this progress is good for the long term security of all of us. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult conditions. They are fighting to defend their nation from Taliban hold outs and helping to strike against the terrorist killers. They are reviving their economy. They have adopted a Constitution that protects the rights of all, while honouring their nation’s most cherished traditions. More than 10 million Afghan citizens over four million of them women are now registered to vote in next month’s presidential election. To any who still would question whether Muslim societies can be democratic societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer. Since the last general debate of this General Assembly, the people of Iraq have regained sovereignty. Today, in this Hall, the Prime Minister of Iraq and his delegation represent a country that has rejoined the community of nations. The Government of Prime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every nation that believes in self determination and desires peace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511  and 1546 , the world is providing that support. The United Nations and its Member nations must respond to Prime Minister Allawi’s request and do more to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal and free. A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies because terrorists know the stakes in that country. They know that a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against their ambitions for that region. So a terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda is now one of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq today, conducting a campaign of bombings against civilians and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition forces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists and foreign fighters so that peaceful nations around the world will never have to face them within our own borders. Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi security force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is providing vital training to that force. More than 35 nations have contributed money and expertise to help rebuild Iraq’s infrastructure and, as the Iraqi Interim Government moves towards national elections, officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis build the infrastructure of democracy. Those selfless people are doing heroic work and are carrying on the great legacy of Sergio Vieira de Mello. As we have seen in other countries, one of the main terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt and influence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist attacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach national elections. The work ahead is demanding, but those difficulties will not shake our conviction that the future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty. The proper response to difficulty is not to retreat it is to prevail. The advance of freedom always carries a cost, paid by the bravest among us. America mourns the losses to our nation and to many others, and today I assure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every enemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and security are fulfilled. These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East, a region where millions have been denied basic human rights and simple justice. For too long, many nations, including my own, tolerated and even excused oppression in the Middle East in the name of stability. Oppression became common, but stability never arrived. We must take a different approach. We must help the reformers of the Middle East as they work for freedom and strive to build a community of peaceful, democratic nations. 11  That commitment to democratic reform is essential to resolving the Arab Israeli conflict. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption and maintain ties to terrorist groups. The long suffering Palestinian people deserve better. They deserve true leaders capable of creating and governing a free and peaceful Palestinian State. Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, good will and hard effort can achieve the promise of the road map to peace. Those who would lead a new Palestinian State should adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people and create the reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab States should end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding for terrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all favour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause. The democratic hopes we see growing in the Middle East are growing everywhere. In the words of the Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi: “We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value. To the contrary, democracy simply means good Government rooted in responsibility, transparency and accountability.” Here at the United Nations, Members know this to be true. In recent years, this Organization has helped create a new democracy in East Timor and the United Nations has aided other nations in making the transition to self rule. Because I believe that the advance of liberty is the path to both a safer and better world, today I propose establishing a democracy fund within the United Nations. This is a great calling for this great Organization. The fund would help countries lay the foundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law, independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions. Money from the fund would also help set up voter precincts and polling places and support the work of election monitors. To show our commitment to the new democracy fund, the United States will make an initial contribution, and I urge all other nations to contribute as well. Today I have outlined a broad agenda to advance human dignity and enhance the security of all of us. The defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the spread of prosperity, the advance of democracy these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the world. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together we can accomplish so much more. History will honour the high ideals of this Organization. The Charter states them with clarity: “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”. Let history also record that our generation of leaders followed through on these ideals, even in adversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade, members of the United Nations did not grow weary in our duties, or waver in meeting them. I am confident that this young century will be liberty’s century. I believe we will rise to this moment, because I know the character of so many nations and leaders represented here today. And I have faith in the transforming power of freedom. May God bless you.'"

Like most of the\\npeople in the world today, I was not even alive during the\\nconvulsive world war that convinced humankind of the need\\nfor this Organization, nor during the San Francisco\\nConference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed the\\nwork of the United Nations throughout my life, with\\nadmiration for its accomplishments, sadness for its failures\\nand the conviction that, through common effort, our\\ngeneration can take the bold steps needed to redeem the\\nmission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. I\\npledge to you that my nation remains committed to helping\\nmake the United Nations vision a reality.\\nThe start of this session of the General Assembly offers\\nus an opportunity to take stock of where we are as common\\nshareholders in the progress of humankind and the\\npreservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at a\\nturning point in human history.\\nImmense and promising changes seem to wash over us\\nevery day. The cold war is over. The world is no longer\\ndivided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of new\\ndemocracies have been born.\\nIt is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandela\\nstand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming a\\ndate for South Africa\\u2019s first non-racial elections.\\nWe see Russia\\u2019s first popularly elected President,\\nBoris Yeltsin, leading his nation on its bold democratic\\njourney.\\nWe have seen decades of deadlock shattered in the\\nMiddle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and the\\nChairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reached\\npast enmity and suspicion to shake each other\\u2019s hand and\\nexhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace.\\nWe have begun to see the doomsday weapons of\\nnuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty-two\\nyears ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly that\\nhumanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hung\\nby the slenderest of threads. Now the United States is\\nworking with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others to take\\nthat sword down, to lock it away in a secure vault, where we\\nhope and pray it will remain for ever.\\nIt is a new era in this Hall as well. The super-Power\\nstandoff that for so long stymied the work of the United\\nNations, almost from its first day, has now yielded to a new\\npromise of practical cooperation.\\nYet today we must all admit that there are two\\npowerful tendencies working from opposite directions to\\nchallenge the authority of nation States everywhere and to\\nundermine the authority of nation States to work together.\\nFrom beyond nations, economic and technological forces all\\nover the globe are compelling the world towards integration.\\nThese forces are fuelling a welcome explosion of\\nentrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they also\\nthreaten to destroy the insularity and independence of\\nnational economies, quickening the pace of change and\\nmaking many of our people feel more insecure. At the same\\ntime, from within nations, the resurgent aspirations of ethnic\\nand religious groups challenge Governments on terms that\\ntraditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. These\\ntwin forces lie at the heart of the challenges, not only to our\\nnational Governments, but also to all our international\\ninstitutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find new\\nways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our\\nnational interests and to think anew about whether our\\ninstitutions of international cooperation are adequate to this\\nmoment.\\nThus, as we marvel at this era\\u2019s promise of new peace,\\nwe must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloody\\nethnic, religious and civil wars rage from Angola to the\\nCaucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fall\\ninto more hands, even small conflicts can threaten to take on\\nmurderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to take\\na tragic toll, especially among the world\\u2019s children. The\\nmalignant neglect of our global environment threatens our\\nchildren\\u2019s health and their very security. The repression of\\nconscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism,\\nwhich has taken so many innocent lives, assumed a\\nhorrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanatics\\nbombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack even\\nthis very Hall of peace.\\nLet me assure the Assembly that whether they be the\\nplotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombed\\nPan Am flight 103, my Government is determined to see that\\nsuch terrorists are brought to justice.\\nAt this moment of panoramic change, of vast\\nopportunities and troubling threats, we must all ask ourselves\\nwhat we can and what we should do as a community of\\nnations. We must once again dare to dream of what might\\nbe, for our dreams may be within our reach.\\nFor that to happen, we must all be willing honestly to\\nconfront the challenges of the broader world. That has never\\nbeen easy. When this Organization was founded 48 years\\nago, the world\\u2019s nations stood devastated by war or\\nexhausted by its expense. There was little appetite for\\ncooperative efforts among nations; most people simply\\nwanted to get on with their lives. But a far-sighted\\ngeneration of leaders from the United States and elsewhere\\nrallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post-\\n-war security and prosperity.\\nWe are at a similar moment today. The momentum of\\nthe cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. And\\nwith daunting economic and political pressures upon almost\\nevery nation represented in this room, many of us are\\nturning to focus greater attention and energy on domestic\\nneeds and problems, and we must.\\nBut putting each of our economic houses in order\\ncannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. The\\npursuit of self-renewal in many of the world\\u2019s largest and\\nmost powerful economies - in Europe, in Japan, in North\\nAmerica - is absolutely crucial, because unless the great\\nindustrial nations can recapture their robust economic\\ngrowth, the global economy will languish. Yet the industrial\\nnations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own.\\nIndeed, prosperity in each of our nations and regions also\\ndepends on active and responsible engagement in a host of\\nshared concerns: for example, a thriving and democratic\\nRussia not only makes the world safer, it also can help to\\nexpand the world\\u2019s economy; a strong GATT (General\\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement will create\\nmillions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East,\\nbuttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated United\\nNations resolutions, can help to unleash that region\\u2019s great\\neconomic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension in\\nglobal affairs; and the growing economic power of China -\\ncoupled with greater political openness - could bring\\nenormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world.\\nWe must help our publics to understand this distinction:\\ndomestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism and\\nprotectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoples\\nto look beyond their immediate fears towards a broader\\nhorizon.\\nLet me start by being clear about where the United\\nStates stands. The United States occupies a unique position\\nin world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcome\\nit. Yet, with the cold war over, I know many people ask\\nwhether the United States plans to retreat or remain active\\nin the world; and if active, to what end? Many people are\\nasking that in our own country as well.\\nLet me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I\\ncan. The United States intends to remain engaged and to\\nlead. We cannot solve every problem, but we must and will\\nserve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace.\\nIn a new era of peril and opportunity, our overriding\\npurpose must be to expand and strengthen the world\\u2019s\\ncommunity of market-based democracies. During the cold\\nwar, we sought to contain a threat to the survival of free\\ninstitutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations that\\nlive under those free institutions.\\nFor our dream is of a day when the opinions and\\nenergies of every person in the world will be given full\\nexpression, in a world of thriving democracies that cooperate\\nwith each other and live in peace.\\nWith this statement, I do not mean to announce some\\ncrusade to force our way of life and doing things on others\\nor to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearly\\nthat throughout the world, from Poland to Eritrea, from\\nGuatemala to South Korea, there is an enormous yearning\\namong people who wish to be the masters of their own\\neconomic and political lives. Where it matters most and\\nwhere we can make the greatest difference, we will therefore\\npatiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning.\\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 9\\nToday, there are still those who claim that democracy\\nis simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recent\\nexpansion is an aberration, an accident in history that will\\nsoon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt, who\\nonce said: \\\"The democratic aspiration is no mere recent\\nphase of human history. It is human history.\\\"\\nWe will work to strengthen the free market democracies\\nby revitalizing our economy at home, by opening world\\ntrade through GATT, the North American Free Trade\\nAgreement and other accords, and by updating our shared\\ninstitutions, asking with you and answering the hard\\nquestions about whether they are adequate to the present\\nchallenges.\\nWe will support the consolidation of market democracy\\nwhere it is taking new root, as in the States of the former\\nSoviet Union and all over Latin America, and we seek to\\nfoster the practices of good government that distribute the\\nbenefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to all\\npeople.\\nWe will work to reduce the threat from regimes that are\\nhostile to democracy and to support liberalization of\\nnon-democratic States when they are willing to live in peace\\nwith the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial,\\nethnic and religious groups within our borders, our policy is\\nand must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world\\u2019s\\nreligions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhere\\nextremism that produces terrorism and hate.\\nAnd we must pursue our humanitarian goals of\\nreducing suffering, fostering sustainable development and\\nimproving health and living conditions, particularly for our\\nworld\\u2019s children.\\nOn efforts from export controls to trade agreements to\\npeace-keeping, we will often work in partnership with others\\nand through multilateral institutions such as the United\\nNations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we must\\nnot hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to our\\ncore interests or to those of our allies.\\nThe United States believes that an expanding\\ncommunity of market democracies not only serves our own\\nsecurity interests, it also advances the goals enshrined in this\\nbody\\u2019s Charter and its Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights.\\nFor broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongest\\nform of preventive diplomacy, and the habits of democracy\\nare the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted in\\ncompromise, not conquest. It rewards tolerance, not hatred.\\nDemocracies rarely wage war on one another. They make\\nmore reliable partners in trade, in diplomacy, and in the\\nstewardship of our global environment. And democracies,\\nwith the rule of law and respect for political, religious and\\ncultural minorities, are more responsive to their own people\\nand to the protection of human rights.\\nBut as we work towards this vision, we must confront\\nthe storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darken\\nthe march towards freedom.\\nIf we do not stem the proliferation of the world\\u2019s\\ndeadliest weapons, no democracy can feel secure.\\nIf we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflicts\\namong and within nations, those conflicts will smother the\\nbirth of free institutions, threaten the development of entire\\nregions and continue to take innocent lives.\\nIf we do not nurture our people and our planet through\\nsustainable development, we will deepen conflict and waste\\nthe very wonders that make our efforts worth doing.\\nLet me talk more about what I believe we must do in\\neach of these three categories: non-proliferation, conflict\\nresolution and sustainable development.\\nOne of our most urgent priorities must be attacking the\\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction - whether\\nnuclear, chemical or biological - and the ballistic missiles\\nthat can rain them down on populations hundreds of miles\\naway.\\nWe know this is not an idle problem. All of us are still\\nhaunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cut\\ndown by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop during\\nthe Gulf War that would have been far graver in their\\nconsequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And we\\nknow that many nations still believe it is in their interests to\\ndevelop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or the\\nnecessary technologies to others for financial gain.\\nMore than a score of nations likely possess such\\nweapons and their number threatens to grow. These\\nweapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a local\\nconflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe.\\nWe simply have got to find ways to control these weapons\\nand to reduce the number of States that possess them by\\nsupporting and strengthening the International Atomic\\nEnergy Agency and by taking other necessary measures.\\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\\nI have made non-proliferation one of our nation\\u2019s\\nhighest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into\\nthe fabric of all of our relationships with the world\\u2019s nations\\nand institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing\\npressure for non-proliferation but increasingly open trade and\\ntechnology for those States that live by accepted\\ninternational rules.\\nToday, let me describe several new policies that our\\nGovernment will pursue to stem proliferation. We will\\npursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear\\nweapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and\\nhighly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear\\nterrorism for all nations. We will press for an international\\nagreement that would ban production of these materials for\\nweapons for ever.\\nAs we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States\\nhas also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban on\\nnuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate\\nthose negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if\\nall other nuclear States would do the same. Today, in the\\nface of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear\\nStates to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop\\nnuclear testing for all time.\\nI am also proposing new efforts to fight the\\nproliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today,\\nonly a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons\\nConvention. I call on all nations - including my own - to\\nratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by\\n13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen the\\nbiological weapons Convention by making every nation\\u2019s\\nbiological activities and facilities open to more international\\nscrutiny.\\nI am proposing as well new steps to thwart the\\nproliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with\\nRussia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made\\nsignificant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to\\nstrengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control\\nRegime by transforming it from an agreement on technology\\ntransfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that can\\ncommand universal adherence.\\nWe will also reform our own system of export controls\\nin the United States to reflect the realities of the post-cold-\\nwar world, where we seek to enlist the support of our former\\nadversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the same\\ntime as we stop deadly technologies from falling into the\\nwrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove\\noutdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce\\nand unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the\\nworld.\\nAs we work to keep the world\\u2019s most destructive\\nweapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the\\ninternational community\\u2019s ability to address those conflicts\\nthemselves. For as we all now know so painfully, the end\\nof the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace.\\nIndeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of\\nethnic, religious and territorial animosity.\\nThe philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a wounded\\nnationalism is like a bent twig, forced down so severely that\\nwhen released, it lashes back with fury. The world today is\\nthick with both bent and recoiling twigs of wounded\\ncommunal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts has\\nplaced high demands on the United Nations peace-keeping\\nforces. Frequently, the Blue Helmets have worked wonders.\\nIn Namibia, El Salvador, the Golan Heights and elsewhere,\\nUnited Nations peace-keepers have helped to stop the\\nfighting, restore civil authority and enable free elections. In\\nBosnia, United Nations peace-keepers, against the danger\\nand frustration of that continuing tragedy, have maintained\\na valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to that\\nconflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace, the\\ninternational community - including the United States - must\\nbe ready to help in its effective implementation.\\nIn Somalia, the United States and the United Nations\\nhave worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarian\\nrescue, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives and\\nrestoring conditions of security to almost the entire country.\\nUnited Nations peace-keepers from over two dozen nations\\nremain in Somalia today - and some, including brave\\nAmericans, have lost their lives - to ensure that we complete\\nour mission and that anarchy and starvation do not return\\njust as quickly as they were abolished.\\nMany still criticize United Nations peace-keeping, but\\nthose who do should talk to the people of Cambodia, where\\nthe United Nations operations helped turn the killing fields\\ninto fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May\\u2019s elections in\\nCambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war--\\nweary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleased\\nto announce that the United States has recognized\\nCambodia\\u2019s new Government.\\nUnited Nations peace-keeping holds the promise to\\nresolve many of this era\\u2019s conflicts. But the reason we have\\nsupported such missions is not, as some critics in the United\\nStates have charged, to subcontract American foreign policy,\\nbut to strengthen our security, to protect our interests, and to\\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11\\nshare among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace.\\nPeace-keeping cannot be a substitute for our own national\\ndefence efforts, but it can strongly supplement them.\\nToday there is wide recognition that the United Nations\\npeace-keeping ability has not kept pace with its rising\\nresponsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago, about\\n10,000 United Nations peace-keepers were stationed around\\nthe world. Today the United Nations has some 80,000\\ndeployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet until\\nrecently, if a peace-keeping commander called in from\\nacross the globe when it was night-time here in New York,\\nthere was no one in the peace-keeping office even to answer\\nthe call. When lives are on the line, we cannot let the reach\\nof the United Nations exceed its grasp.\\nAs the Secretary-General and others have argued, if\\nUnited Nations peace-keeping is to be a sound security\\ninvestment for our nation and for other United Nations\\nMembers, it must adapt to new times. Together, we must\\nprepare United Nations peace-keeping for the twenty-first\\ncentury. We need to begin by bringing the rigours of\\nmilitary and political analysis to every United Nations peace\\nmission. In recent weeks in the Security Council, our nation\\nhas begun asking harder questions about proposals for new\\npeace-keeping missions. Is there a real threat to\\ninternational peace? Does the proposed mission have clear\\nobjectives? Can an end point be identified for those who\\nwill be asked to participate? How much will the mission\\ncost? From now on the United Nations should address these\\nand other questions for every proposed mission before we\\nvote and before the mission begins. The United Nations\\nsimply cannot become engaged in every one of the world\\u2019s\\nconflicts. If the American people are to say \\\"Yes\\\" to United\\nNations peace-keeping, the United Nations must know when\\nto say \\\"No\\\".\\nThe United Nations also must have the technical means\\nto run a modern, world-class peace-keeping operation. We\\nsupport the creation of a genuine United Nations peace-\\nkeeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access to\\ntimely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployed\\non a moment\\u2019s notice; and with a modern operations centre\\nwith global communications.\\nUnited Nations operations must not only be adequately\\nfunded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks,\\nthe United States will be current on our peace-keeping bills.\\nI have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I\\nbelieve the United States should lead the way in being\\ntimely in its payments, and I will work to ensure that we\\ncontinue to pay our peace-keeping bills in full. But I am\\nalso committed to working with the United Nations to reduce\\nour nation\\u2019s assessment for these missions. The assessment\\nsystem has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in\\nour country knows that our percentage of the world\\u2019s\\neconomic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I\\nbelieve our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other\\nnations that can now bear more of the financial burden.\\nThat will make it easier for me as President to make sure\\nmy country pays in a timely and full fashion.\\nChanges in the United Nations peace-keeping operations\\nmust be part of an even broader programme of United\\nNations reform. I say that, again, not to criticize the United\\nNations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador,\\nMadeleine Albright, has suggested, the United States has\\nalways played a twin role in regard to the United Nations:\\n\\\"First friend and first critic.\\\"\\nToday, corporations around the world are finding ways\\nto move from the industrial age into the information age -\\nimproving service, reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs.\\nHere in the United States, Vice President Al Gore and I have\\nlaunched an effort literally to reinvent how our Government\\noperates. We see this going on in other Governments\\naround the world. Now the time has come to reinvent the\\nway the United Nations operates as well.\\nI applaud the initial steps the Secretary-General has\\ntaken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy.\\nNow we must all do even more to root out waste. Before\\nthis General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong\\nmandate for an office of inspector general, so that it can\\nattain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for\\neffectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our\\npeople that the United Nations is changing with the needs of\\nour times.\\nUltimately, the key for reforming the United Nations,\\nas for reforming our own government, is to remember why\\nwe are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that the\\nfirst words of the United Nations Charter are not, \\\"We the\\nGovernments\\\", but \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\".\\nThat means, in every country, the teachers, the workers, the\\nfarmers, the professionals, the fathers, the mothers, the\\nchildren, from the most remote village in the world to the\\nlargest metropolis - they are why we gather in this great\\nHall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail to\\nact; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills.\\nAs we dream new dreams in this age when miracles\\nseem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and\\nespecially on the children who will inherit this world. Let\\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\\nus work with a new urgency, and imagine what kind of\\nworld we could create for them over the coming generation.\\nLet us work with new energy to protect the world\\u2019s\\npeople from torture and repression. As Secretary of State\\nChristopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference, human\\nrights are not something conditional, bounded by culture but,\\nrather, something universal, granted by God. This General\\nAssembly should create, at long last, a high commissioner\\nfor human rights. I hope it will do this soon, and with\\nvigour and energy and conviction.\\nLet us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil our\\nobligations as custodians of this planet, not only to improve\\nthe quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air,\\nwater and the earth itself, but also because the roots of\\nconflict are so often entangled with the roots of\\nenvironmental neglect and the calamities of famine and\\ndisease.\\nDuring the course of our campaign in the United States\\nlast year, Vice President Gore and I promised the American\\npeople major changes in our nation\\u2019s policy towards the\\nglobal environment. Those were promises to keep, and\\ntoday the United States is doing so. Today we are working\\nwith other nations to build on the promising work of the\\nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.\\nWe are working to make sure that all nations meet their\\ncommitments under the global climate Convention. We are\\nseeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the\\nworld\\u2019s deserts from further expanding. And we seek to\\nstrengthen the World Health Organization\\u2019s efforts to combat\\nthe plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but\\nalso exhausting the resources of the nations that can least\\nafford it.\\nAnd let us make a new commitment to the world\\u2019s\\nchildren. It is tragic enough that one and a half million\\nchildren have died as a result of wars over the past decade.\\nBut it is far more unforgivable that during that same period\\n40 million children have died from diseases completely\\npreventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day\\n- this day, as we meet here - over 30,000 of the world\\u2019s\\nchildren will die of malnutrition and disease. As the\\nDirector of the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),\\nJim Grant, has reminded me, \\\"each of [those children] had\\na name and a nationality, a family, a personality and a\\npotential\\\".\\nWe are compelled to do better by the world\\u2019s children.\\nJust as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure\\nthat every child has adequate health care, we must do more\\nto get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable\\ndiseases to children all over the world. It\\u2019s the best\\ninvestment we\\u2019ll ever make. We can find new ways to\\nensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water\\n- that most precious commodity of life itself. And the\\nUnited Nations can work even harder to ensure that each\\nchild has at least a full primary education - and I mean that\\nopportunity for girls as well as boys.\\nTo ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we\\nsimply must slow the world\\u2019s explosive growth in\\npopulation. We cannot afford to see the human race double\\nby the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last\\nrenewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to\\nexpand the availability of the world\\u2019s family planning\\neducation and services. We must ensure that there is a place\\nat the table for every one of the world\\u2019s children. We can\\ndo this.\\nAt the birth of this Organization, 48 years ago - another\\ntime of both victory and danger - a generation of gifted\\nleaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the\\nworld\\u2019s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. One\\nAmerican leader during that period said this: \\\"It is time we\\nsteered by the stars rather than by the light of each passing\\nship.\\\" His generation picked peace, human dignity and\\nfreedom. Those are good stars. They should remain the\\nhighest in our firmament.\\nNow history has granted to us a moment of even\\ngreater opportunity, when old dangers are ebbing and old\\nwalls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us, every\\none of us, above all by what we make of this magic\\nmoment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger, that we\\nwill work harder, so that they can conclude that we did not\\nmerely turn walls to rubble, but instead laid the foundations\\nfor great things to come.\\nLet us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracy\\nis not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Let\\nus ensure that the world\\u2019s most dangerous weapons are\\nsafely reduced and denied to dangerous hands.

Mr Secretary General, distinguished representatives and guests, it is a great honour for me to address you and to stand in this great Hall, which symbolizes so much of the twentieth century   its darkest crises and its brightest aspirations. I come before you as the first American President born after the founding of the United Nations. Like most of the people in the world today, I was not even alive during the convulsive world war that convinced humankind of the need for this Organization, nor during the San Francisco Conference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed the work of the United Nations throughout my life, with admiration for its accomplishments, sadness for its failures and the conviction that, through common effort, our generation can take the bold steps needed to redeem the mission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. I pledge to you that my nation remains committed to helping make the United Nations vision a reality. The start of this session of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity to take stock of where we are as common shareholders in the progress of humankind and the preservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at a turning point in human history. Immense and promising changes seem to wash over us every day. The cold war is over. The world is no longer divided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of new democracies have been born. It is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandela stand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming a date for South Africa\\u2019s first non racial elections. We see Russia\\u2019s first popularly elected President, Boris Yeltsin, leading his nation on its bold democratic journey. We have seen decades of deadlock shattered in the Middle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reached past enmity and suspicion to shake each other\\u2019s hand and exhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace. We have begun to see the doomsday weapons of nuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty two years ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly that humanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hung by the slenderest of threads. Now the United States is working with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others to take that sword down, to lock it away in a secure vault, where we hope and pray it will remain for ever. It is a new era in this Hall as well. The super Power standoff that for so long stymied the work of the United Nations, almost from its first day, has now yielded to a new promise of practical cooperation. Yet today we must all admit that there are two powerful tendencies working from opposite directions to challenge the authority of nation States everywhere and to undermine the authority of nation States to work together. From beyond nations, economic and technological forces all over the globe are compelling the world towards integration. These forces are fuelling a welcome explosion of entrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they also threaten to destroy the insularity and independence of national economies, quickening the pace of change and making many of our people feel more insecure. At the same time, from within nations, the resurgent aspirations of ethnic and religious groups challenge Governments on terms that traditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. These twin forces lie at the heart of the challenges, not only to our national Governments, but also to all our international institutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find new ways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our national interests and to think anew about whether our institutions of international cooperation are adequate to this moment. Thus, as we marvel at this era\\u2019s promise of new peace, we must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloody ethnic, religious and civil wars rage from Angola to the Caucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fall into more hands, even small conflicts can threaten to take on murderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to take a tragic toll, especially among the world\\u2019s children. The malignant neglect of our global environment threatens our children\\u2019s health and their very security. The repression of conscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism, which has taken so many innocent lives, assumed a horrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanatics bombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack even this very Hall of peace. Let me assure the Assembly that whether they be the plotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombed Pan Am flight 103, my Government is determined to see that such terrorists are brought to justice. At this moment of panoramic change, of vast opportunities and troubling threats, we must all ask ourselves what we can and what we should do as a community of nations. We must once again dare to dream of what might be, for our dreams may be within our reach. For that to happen, we must all be willing honestly to confront the challenges of the broader world. That has never been easy. When this Organization was founded 48 years ago, the world\\u2019s nations stood devastated by war or exhausted by its expense. There was little appetite for cooperative efforts among nations; most people simply wanted to get on with their lives. But a far sighted generation of leaders from the United States and elsewhere rallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post   war security and prosperity. We are at a similar moment today. The momentum of the cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. And with daunting economic and political pressures upon almost every nation represented in this room, many of us are turning to focus greater attention and energy on domestic needs and problems, and we must. But putting each of our economic houses in order cannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. The pursuit of self renewal in many of the world\\u2019s largest and most powerful economies   in Europe, in Japan, in North America   is absolutely crucial, because unless the great industrial nations can recapture their robust economic growth, the global economy will languish. Yet the industrial nations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own. Indeed, prosperity in each of our nations and regions also depends on active and responsible engagement in a host of shared concerns: for example, a thriving and democratic Russia not only makes the world safer, it also can help to expand the world\\u2019s economy; a strong GATT  agreement will create millions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East, buttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated United Nations resolutions, can help to unleash that region\\u2019s great economic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension in global affairs; and the growing economic power of China   coupled with greater political openness   could bring enormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world. We must help our publics to understand this distinction: domestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism and protectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoples to look beyond their immediate fears towards a broader horizon. Let me start by being clear about where the United States stands. The United States occupies a unique position in world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcome it. Yet, with the cold war over, I know many people ask whether the United States plans to retreat or remain active in the world; and if active, to what end? Many people are asking that in our own country as well. Let me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I can. The United States intends to remain engaged and to lead. We cannot solve every problem, but we must and will serve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace. In a new era of peril and opportunity, our overriding purpose must be to expand and strengthen the world\\u2019s community of market based democracies. During the cold war, we sought to contain a threat to the survival of free institutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations that live under those free institutions. For our dream is of a day when the opinions and energies of every person in the world will be given full expression, in a world of thriving democracies that cooperate with each other and live in peace. With this statement, I do not mean to announce some crusade to force our way of life and doing things on others or to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearly that throughout the world, from Poland to Eritrea, from Guatemala to South Korea, there is an enormous yearning among people who wish to be the masters of their own economic and political lives. Where it matters most and where we can make the greatest difference, we will therefore patiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning. Forty eighth session   27 September l993 9 Today, there are still those who claim that democracy is simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recent expansion is an aberration, an accident in history that will soon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt, who once said: The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase of human history. It is human history. We will work to strengthen the free market democracies by revitalizing our economy at home, by opening world trade through GATT, the North American Free Trade Agreement and other accords, and by updating our shared institutions, asking with you and answering the hard questions about whether they are adequate to the present challenges. We will support the consolidation of market democracy where it is taking new root, as in the States of the former Soviet Union and all over Latin America, and we seek to foster the practices of good government that distribute the benefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to all people. We will work to reduce the threat from regimes that are hostile to democracy and to support liberalization of non democratic States when they are willing to live in peace with the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial, ethnic and religious groups within our borders, our policy is and must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world\\u2019s religions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhere extremism that produces terrorism and hate. And we must pursue our humanitarian goals of reducing suffering, fostering sustainable development and improving health and living conditions, particularly for our world\\u2019s children. On efforts from export controls to trade agreements to peace keeping, we will often work in partnership with others and through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we must not hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to our core interests or to those of our allies. The United States believes that an expanding community of market democracies not only serves our own security interests, it also advances the goals enshrined in this body\\u2019s Charter and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongest form of preventive diplomacy, and the habits of democracy are the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted in compromise, not conquest. It rewards tolerance, not hatred. Democracies rarely wage war on one another. They make more reliable partners in trade, in diplomacy, and in the stewardship of our global environment. And democracies, with the rule of law and respect for political, religious and cultural minorities, are more responsive to their own people and to the protection of human rights. But as we work towards this vision, we must confront the storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darken the march towards freedom. If we do not stem the proliferation of the world\\u2019s deadliest weapons, no democracy can feel secure. If we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflicts among and within nations, those conflicts will smother the birth of free institutions, threaten the development of entire regions and continue to take innocent lives. If we do not nurture our people and our planet through sustainable development, we will deepen conflict and waste the very wonders that make our efforts worth doing. Let me talk more about what I believe we must do in each of these three categories: non proliferation, conflict resolution and sustainable development. One of our most urgent priorities must be attacking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction   whether nuclear, chemical or biological   and the ballistic missiles that can rain them down on populations hundreds of miles away. We know this is not an idle problem. All of us are still haunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cut down by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop during the Gulf War that would have been far graver in their consequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And we know that many nations still believe it is in their interests to develop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or the necessary technologies to others for financial gain. More than a score of nations likely possess such weapons and their number threatens to grow. These weapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a local conflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe. We simply have got to find ways to control these weapons and to reduce the number of States that possess them by supporting and strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency and by taking other necessary measures. 10 General Assembly   Forty eighth session I have made non proliferation one of our nation\\u2019s highest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into the fabric of all of our relationships with the world\\u2019s nations and institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing pressure for non proliferation but increasingly open trade and technology for those States that live by accepted international rules. Today, let me describe several new policies that our Government will pursue to stem proliferation. We will pursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear weapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and highly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear terrorism for all nations. We will press for an international agreement that would ban production of these materials for weapons for ever. As we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States has also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate those negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if all other nuclear States would do the same. Today, in the face of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear States to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop nuclear testing for all time. I am also proposing new efforts to fight the proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today, only a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons Convention. I call on all nations   including my own   to ratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by 13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen the biological weapons Convention by making every nation\\u2019s biological activities and facilities open to more international scrutiny. I am proposing as well new steps to thwart the proliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with Russia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made significant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to strengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control Regime by transforming it from an agreement on technology transfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that can command universal adherence. We will also reform our own system of export controls in the United States to reflect the realities of the post cold  war world, where we seek to enlist the support of our former adversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the same time as we stop deadly technologies from falling into the wrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove outdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce and unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the world. As we work to keep the world\\u2019s most destructive weapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the international community\\u2019s ability to address those conflicts themselves. For as we all now know so painfully, the end of the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace. Indeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of ethnic, religious and territorial animosity. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a wounded nationalism is like a bent twig, forced down so severely that when released, it lashes back with fury. The world today is thick with both bent and recoiling twigs of wounded communal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts has placed high demands on the United Nations peace keeping forces. Frequently, the Blue Helmets have worked wonders. In Namibia, El Salvador, the Golan Heights and elsewhere, United Nations peace keepers have helped to stop the fighting, restore civil authority and enable free elections. In Bosnia, United Nations peace keepers, against the danger and frustration of that continuing tragedy, have maintained a valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to that conflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace, the international community   including the United States   must be ready to help in its effective implementation. In Somalia, the United States and the United Nations have worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarian rescue, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives and restoring conditions of security to almost the entire country. United Nations peace keepers from over two dozen nations remain in Somalia today   and some, including brave Americans, have lost their lives   to ensure that we complete our mission and that anarchy and starvation do not return just as quickly as they were abolished. Many still criticize United Nations peace keeping, but those who do should talk to the people of Cambodia, where the United Nations operations helped turn the killing fields into fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May\\u2019s elections in Cambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war   weary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleased to announce that the United States has recognized Cambodia\\u2019s new Government. United Nations peace keeping holds the promise to resolve many of this era\\u2019s conflicts. But the reason we have supported such missions is not, as some critics in the United States have charged, to subcontract American foreign policy, but to strengthen our security, to protect our interests, and to Forty eighth session   27 September l993 11 share among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace. Peace keeping cannot be a substitute for our own national defence efforts, but it can strongly supplement them. Today there is wide recognition that the United Nations peace keeping ability has not kept pace with its rising responsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago, about 10,000 United Nations peace keepers were stationed around the world. Today the United Nations has some 80,000 deployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet until recently, if a peace keeping commander called in from across the globe when it was night time here in New York, there was no one in the peace keeping office even to answer the call. When lives are on the line, we cannot let the reach of the United Nations exceed its grasp. As the Secretary General and others have argued, if United Nations peace keeping is to be a sound security investment for our nation and for other United Nations Members, it must adapt to new times. Together, we must prepare United Nations peace keeping for the twenty first century. We need to begin by bringing the rigours of military and political analysis to every United Nations peace mission. In recent weeks in the Security Council, our nation has begun asking harder questions about proposals for new peace keeping missions. Is there a real threat to international peace? Does the proposed mission have clear objectives? Can an end point be identified for those who will be asked to participate? How much will the mission cost? From now on the United Nations should address these and other questions for every proposed mission before we vote and before the mission begins. The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world\\u2019s conflicts. If the American people are to say Yes to United Nations peace keeping, the United Nations must know when to say No. The United Nations also must have the technical means to run a modern, world class peace keeping operation. We support the creation of a genuine United Nations peace  keeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access to timely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployed on a moment\\u2019s notice; and with a modern operations centre with global communications. United Nations operations must not only be adequately funded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks, the United States will be current on our peace keeping bills. I have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I believe the United States should lead the way in being timely in its payments, and I will work to ensure that we continue to pay our peace keeping bills in full. But I am also committed to working with the United Nations to reduce our nation\\u2019s assessment for these missions. The assessment system has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in our country knows that our percentage of the world\\u2019s economic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I believe our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other nations that can now bear more of the financial burden. That will make it easier for me as President to make sure my country pays in a timely and full fashion. Changes in the United Nations peace keeping operations must be part of an even broader programme of United Nations reform. I say that, again, not to criticize the United Nations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador, Madeleine Albright, has suggested, the United States has always played a twin role in regard to the United Nations: First friend and first critic. Today, corporations around the world are finding ways to move from the industrial age into the information age   improving service, reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs. Here in the United States, Vice President Al Gore and I have launched an effort literally to reinvent how our Government operates. We see this going on in other Governments around the world. Now the time has come to reinvent the way the United Nations operates as well. I applaud the initial steps the Secretary General has taken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy. Now we must all do even more to root out waste. Before this General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong mandate for an office of inspector general, so that it can attain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for effectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our people that the United Nations is changing with the needs of our times. Ultimately, the key for reforming the United Nations, as for reforming our own government, is to remember why we are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that the first words of the United Nations Charter are not, We the Governments, but We the peoples of the United Nations. That means, in every country, the teachers, the workers, the farmers, the professionals, the fathers, the mothers, the children, from the most remote village in the world to the largest metropolis   they are why we gather in this great Hall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail to act; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills. As we dream new dreams in this age when miracles seem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and especially on the children who will inherit this world. Let 12 General Assembly   Forty eighth session us work with a new urgency, and imagine what kind of world we could create for them over the coming generation. Let us work with new energy to protect the world\\u2019s people from torture and repression. As Secretary of State Christopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference, human rights are not something conditional, bounded by culture but, rather, something universal, granted by God. This General Assembly should create, at long last, a high commissioner for human rights. I hope it will do this soon, and with vigour and energy and conviction. Let us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil our obligations as custodians of this planet, not only to improve the quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air, water and the earth itself, but also because the roots of conflict are so often entangled with the roots of environmental neglect and the calamities of famine and disease. During the course of our campaign in the United States last year, Vice President Gore and I promised the American people major changes in our nation\\u2019s policy towards the global environment. Those were promises to keep, and today the United States is doing so. Today we are working with other nations to build on the promising work of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. We are working to make sure that all nations meet their commitments under the global climate Convention. We are seeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the world\\u2019s deserts from further expanding. And we seek to strengthen the World Health Organization\\u2019s efforts to combat the plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but also exhausting the resources of the nations that can least afford it. And let us make a new commitment to the world\\u2019s children. It is tragic enough that one and a half million children have died as a result of wars over the past decade. But it is far more unforgivable that during that same period 40 million children have died from diseases completely preventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day   this day, as we meet here   over 30,000 of the world\\u2019s children will die of malnutrition and disease. As the Director of the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund , Jim Grant, has reminded me, each of  had a name and a nationality, a family, a personality and a potential. We are compelled to do better by the world\\u2019s children. Just as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure that every child has adequate health care, we must do more to get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable diseases to children all over the world. It\\u2019s the best investment we\\u2019ll ever make. We can find new ways to ensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water   that most precious commodity of life itself. And the United Nations can work even harder to ensure that each child has at least a full primary education   and I mean that opportunity for girls as well as boys. To ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we simply must slow the world\\u2019s explosive growth in population. We cannot afford to see the human race double by the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last renewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to expand the availability of the world\\u2019s family planning education and services. We must ensure that there is a place at the table for every one of the world\\u2019s children. We can do this. At the birth of this Organization, 48 years ago   another time of both victory and danger   a generation of gifted leaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the world\\u2019s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. One American leader during that period said this: It is time we steered by the stars rather than by the light of each passing ship. His generation picked peace, human dignity and freedom. Those are good stars. They should remain the highest in our firmament. Now history has granted to us a moment of even greater opportunity, when old dangers are ebbing and old walls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us, every one of us, above all by what we make of this magic moment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger, that we will work harder, so that they can conclude that we did not merely turn walls to rubble, but instead laid the foundations for great things to come. Let us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracy is not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Let us ensure that the world\\u2019s most dangerous weapons are safely reduced and denied to dangerous hands. Let us ensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier, safer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today. I believe   I know   that together we can extend this moment of miracles into an age of great works and new wonders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
